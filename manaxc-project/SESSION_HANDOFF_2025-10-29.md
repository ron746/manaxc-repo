# Session Handoff - October 29, 2025

## Session Summary
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Focus:** Debugging import failures and sprint planning

## Critical Issue Discovered

### Orphaned References Blocking Result Imports

**Problem:**
- Attempted to import meet 254032 ("Flat SAC")
- Only 3 out of 1,314 results imported (99.8% failure rate)
- Error: `athlete_best_times_season_best_result_id_fkey` foreign key constraint violation

**Root Cause:**
- `athlete_best_times` table contains references to result IDs that no longer exist
- When inserting new results, database trigger checks these orphaned references and fails
- Likely caused by previous data cleanup operations that deleted results without updating best_times table

**Impact:**
- Blocks ALL result imports for athletes with orphaned references
- Currently blocking completion of meet 254032 and all other pending imports

**Fix Created:**
- Script: `/Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/code/importers/FIX_ORPHANED_REFERENCES.py`
- What it does: Scans all 1,776 athlete_best_times records, finds orphaned references, sets them to NULL
- Status: Ready to run (interactive, asks for confirmation before changes)

## Work Completed

### 1. Import System Debugging
- Discovered import slowness was due to network latency (expected for cloud DB)
- Improved error logging in `import_csv_data.py` (lines 685-686, 702-703)
- Changed from silent failures to explicit error messages
- Created multiple diagnostic scripts to isolate the issue

### 2. Documentation Created
**Files Created:**
- `NEXT_SPRINT_PRIORITIES.md` - Complete sprint plan with all requested features
- `code/importers/IMPORT_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed issue documentation
- `code/importers/FIX_ORPHANED_REFERENCES.py` - Database cleanup script
- `SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-10-29.md` - This file

**Files Updated:**
- `CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` - Added AI Memory Wall strategy and logging best practices
  - New section: AI Memory Wall Strategy
  - New section: Logging Best Practices (Python + TypeScript examples)
  - Updated: Critical Issues section with orphaned references issue
  - Updated: Next Sprint Priorities to reference new document
  - Updated: System Status to reflect current critical issue
- `code/importers/import_csv_data.py` - Enhanced error logging

### 3. Diagnostic Scripts Created
All in `/Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/code/importers/`:
- `check_meet_254032_results.py` - Verify meet exists in DB
- `check_duplicate_meet.py` - Check for duplicate meets
- `check_orphaned_fast.py` - Quick orphan check
- `check_grady_jenkins.py` - Check specific athlete
- `find_orphaned_result.py` - Find specific orphaned ID
- `find_all_orphaned.py` - Comprehensive orphan scan
- `test_single_result_insert.py` - Test individual result insert

## Sprint Planning Complete

Created comprehensive `NEXT_SPRINT_PRIORITIES.md` with all requested features:

**P0 - Critical:**
1. Fix orphaned references (script ready)
2. Finish importing all pending results

**P1 - High Priority:**
3. Test for duplicate athletes
4. Delete operations (result, race, meet)
5. Mark time unofficial
6. Fix seasons page
7. Fix maintenance page
8. Import single file at a time via UI
9. Investigate "intrasquad" meet validation issue

**Technical Debt:**
- Implement proper logging (Python + TypeScript)
- Add audit logging for admin operations

## Database Status

### Current State
- Meet 254032 exists: Yes (ID: `8d4f3a37-4878-49a6-8a3d-0c7a4a3274dc`)
- Results for meet 254032: **Only 3** (should be 1,314)
- Races created: 9 (all successful)
- Schools created: 37 (21 new, 83 existing)
- Athletes created: 1,738 (all successful)
- Total athlete_best_times records: 1,776
- Orphaned references: Unknown count (need to run full scan)

### Meet 254032 Location
- CSV data: `/Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/code/importers/to-be-processed/processed/1761769077/meet_254032_1761715973/`
- Original location was `to-be-processed/meet_254032_1761715973/` before first import moved it

## Next Session - CRITICAL ACTIONS

### Step 1: Fix Orphaned References (MUST DO FIRST)
```bash
cd /Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/code/importers
venv/bin/python3 FIX_ORPHANED_REFERENCES.py
# Follow prompts, type "yes" to confirm cleanup
```

### Step 2: Re-import Meet 254032
```bash
venv/bin/python3 import_csv_data.py ./to-be-processed/processed/1761769077/meet_254032_1761715973
```
Expected result: All 1,314 results should import (vs 3 currently)

### Step 3: Continue with Pending Imports
After confirming meet 254032 works, import other meets in `to-be-processed/` folder

## Files Modified (Need Commit)

**New Files:**
- `NEXT_SPRINT_PRIORITIES.md`

- `code/importers/IMPORT_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md`

- `code/importers/check_*.py` (7 diagnostic scripts)
- `code/importers/find_*.py` (2 diagnostic scripts)
- `code/importers/test_single_result_insert.py`

**Modified Files:**
- `CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` - Major updates (AI Memory Wall, logging, critical issues)
- `code/importers/import_csv_data.py` - Lines 685-686, 702-703 (error logging)

**Log Files (Don't Commit):**
- `code/importers/import_254032.log`
- `code/importers/import_254032_retry.log`

## Important Notes

### Performance Insight
The "slow" import speed (10+ minutes for schools) is **normal** and expected:
- Supabase is cloud-hosted (network latency ~50-100ms per query)
- Each school requires 2 queries: check existence + insert if new
- 104 schools × 2 queries × 75ms average = ~15-20 seconds just for schools
- Additional time for 1,838 athletes with similar checking
- A newer MacBook would only save 2-3 seconds (negligible)

### Error Logging Improvement
Previously, failed inserts were silently caught with no error messages. Now:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"      ❌ Failed to insert result: {str(e)[:100]}")
    stats['skipped_results'] += 1
```
This made it possible to discover the orphaned references issue.

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we add indexes to speed up orphan detection queries?
2. Should we add a database trigger to prevent orphan creation in the future?
3. Should we implement soft deletes instead of hard deletes to avoid this issue?
