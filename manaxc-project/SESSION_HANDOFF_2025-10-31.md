# Session Handoff - October 31, 2025

**Session Time:** October 31, 2025 (Late evening)
**Focus:** Course Difficulty Calibration System - Malcolm Slaney Method Implementation
**Status:** âœ… System Working - Needs Refinement

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Network Calibration API âœ…

**Problem:** Calibration failing with "Failed to calculate calibrations" error

**Root Causes Found:**
1. Schema error: `meets.date` â†’ `meets.meet_date` in API route
2. Missing parameter: API passing `distance_tolerance_pct` to SQL function that doesn't accept it
3. Wrong count query syntax

**Files Fixed:**
- `/website/app/api/admin/network-course-calibration-optimized/route.ts`
  - Line 67: `meets!inner(date)` â†’ `meets!inner(meet_date)`
  - Line 87: `r.meets.date` â†’ `r.meets.meet_date`
  - Line 143: `meets!inner(date)` â†’ `meets!inner(meet_date)`
  - Line 162: `r.meets.date` â†’ `r.meets.meet_date`
  - Line 35: Fixed count query to use proper join syntax
  - Line 41-46: Removed invalid `distance_tolerance_pct` parameter

**Result:** Network calibration now runs successfully from admin UI

### 2. Course Calibration System Status

**What Works:**
- SQL function `get_all_course_calibrations()` executing successfully
- Admin UI at `/admin/network-calibration` displaying results
- Dual anchor system configured (Crystal Springs 1.0, Woodward Park 0.95)
- Confidence scoring working (all single-season courses at 0.40)
- Recommendations being saved to `course_difficulty_recommendations` table

**Current Results (23 Courses Analyzed):**

| Course | Distance | Current Diff | Implied Diff | Discrepancy | Athletes | Confidence |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Crystal Springs, 2.95 mi | 2.95 | 1.177163037 | 1.177163037 | 0% | 1,553 | 100% |
| Lagoon Valley Park, 3 mi | 3.00 | 1.183048852 | 0.861110575 | -27.2% | 110 | 84% |
| Crystal Springs, 2.13 mi | 2.13 | 1.104178929 | 0.906980006 | -17.9% | 25 | 24% |
| North Monterey County, 3 mi | 3.00 | 1.224853686 | 1.129554982 | -7.8% | 430 | 96% |
| Newhall Park, 2 mi | 2.00 | 1.104649794 | 1.178836586 | +6.7% | 73 | 68% |
| Newhall Park, 3 mi | 3.00 | 1.114773396 | 1.187988411 | +6.6% | 128 | 97% |

**Summary:**
- 23 total courses analyzed
- 18 high confidence (>30% confidence)
- 5 need review (>5% discrepancy)

### 3. Existing Migrations Applied

**Successfully Applied:**
- `20251030_correct_malcolm_slaney_method.sql` - Malcolm Slaney outlier analysis function
- `20251030_add_course_confidence.sql` - Confidence scoring system
- `20251030_athlete_improvement_model.sql` - Athlete-specific improvement rates
- `20251031_fix_confidence_calculation.sql` - Stricter single-season penalty
- `20251031_set_dual_anchors.sql` - Crystal Springs 1.0, Woodward Park 0.95
- `20251031_fix_outlier_analysis_ambiguity.sql` - Fixed variable naming conflicts

**Functions Created:**
- `get_course_outlier_analysis(anchor_course, improvement_rate, outlier_threshold)` - Malcolm Slaney method
- `calculate_course_confidence(course_id)` - Confidence scoring 0.0-1.0
- `calculate_athlete_improvement_rate(athlete_id)` - Athlete-specific improvement
- `get_all_course_calibrations(anchor_course)` - Network calibration (all courses at once)

## Issues Discovered - Needs Next Session

### ðŸ”´ Issue 1: Distance-Effect Confounding Still Present

**Problem:** Current `get_all_course_calibrations()` function compares ALL courses to Crystal Springs 2.95 miles, regardless of distance.

**Evidence:**
- Crystal Springs 2.13 miles shows -17.9% discrepancy
- This captures PACING differences, not terrain difficulty
- 2.13 miles run faster per-mile than 2.95 miles due to race strategy

**What Malcolm Slaney Said:**
> "This is why my recommendation was to compare an athletes normalized_time_cs... If you start to see lots of runners having oddly fast times on one course you have an issue"

**Fix Required:**
Update `get_all_course_calibrations()` to filter courses:
```sql
-- Only compare courses within Â±15% distance
WHERE c.distance_meters BETWEEN
  FLOOR(anchor_distance * 0.85) AND
  CEIL(anchor_distance * 1.15)
```

**Location:** `/website/supabase/migrations/20251030_optimize_course_analysis_CORRECTED.sql:145-231`

**Impact:**
- Crystal Springs 2.13 should be excluded from 2.95 comparison
- Would reduce course count but increase accuracy
- Newhall 2-mile should also be excluded

### ðŸŸ¡ Issue 2: Lagoon Valley Park Outlier

**Result:** -27.2% discrepancy (110 athletes, 84% confidence)

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Course actually is easier than rated
2. Measurement error in course distance
3. Athletic.net data quality issue
4. Distance-effect confounding (need to verify exact distance)

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check actual distance: Is it exactly 3.0 miles or could it be shorter?
- Review athlete comparisons: Are elite runners faster here?
- Cross-validate with other anchors (Woodward Park)

### ðŸŸ¡ Issue 3: North Monterey County Discrepancy

**Result:** -7.8% discrepancy (430 athletes, 96% confidence)

**High confidence score** (96%) means this is likely real, not noise.

**Possible Actions:**
1. Accept adjustment (reduce difficulty 1.2249 â†’ 1.1296)
2. Investigate course changes (was it remeasured?)
3. Wait for more data (cross-validate with 2025 season)

### ðŸ“‹ Issue 4: Two Malcolm Slaney Methods Implemented

**Current State:**
1. **`get_course_outlier_analysis()`** - CORRECT method:
   - Uses time differences (not ratios)
   - Accounts for athlete improvement
   - Filters by distance (Â±15%)
   - Returns outlier statistics

2. **`get_all_course_calibrations()`** - OLD ratio method:
   - Uses performance ratios
   - No athlete improvement adjustment
   - No distance filtering
   - Faster (single query)

**Decision Needed:**
- Keep both? (One for analysis, one for UI)
- Migrate UI to use `get_course_outlier_analysis()`?
- Update `get_all_course_calibrations()` to match Malcolm's method?

## Data Limitations

### Single-Season Reality Check

**User Quote:** "I only have 2024 data"

**Implications:**
1. Cannot calculate season-to-season variance
2. Cannot measure athlete improvement rates accurately
3. Cannot detect course changes over time
4. All courses (except anchors) stuck at ~0.40 confidence

**What This Means:**
- Crystal Springs: 1.0 confidence (50 years validation by Malcolm Slaney + coaches)
- Woodward Park: 0.95 confidence (proven elite program usage)
- Everything else: 0.30-0.50 confidence (single season, "iffy")

**User's Pragmatic Take:** "that's ok. we can stick with this for now and with more data it will all improve"

### Elite Runner Analysis

**User Insight:** "this is why we need to pick just the 3 to 5 fastest kids"

**Current Data:**
- 67 athletes ran both Crystal Springs and Woodward Park
- Only 1 elite athlete (< 32000 cs normalized) ran both
- Median difference: 10.81 sec/mile between anchors

**Implication:** Not enough elite overlap for robust cross-validation yet

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Add Distance Filtering to `get_all_course_calibrations()`**
   - Location: `20251030_optimize_course_analysis_CORRECTED.sql:145-231`
   - Add `distance_tolerance_pct` parameter
   - Filter WHERE clause to Â±15% of anchor distance
   - Test that Crystal Springs 2.13 gets excluded

2. **Investigate Lagoon Valley Park**
   - Check actual course distance in database
   - Query elite athlete performances
   - Cross-validate with Woodward Park anchor

3. **Create Calibration Recommendation Report**
   - Which courses need adjustment?
   - Which are within acceptable range (< 5% error)?
   - What's the confidence level for each recommendation?

### Medium Term (This Week)

4. **Implement Elite Runner Filter**
   - Add option to calibrate using only top 5 athletes per course
   - Compare results with all-athlete calibration

5. **Add Woodward Park Cross-Validation**
   - Run calibration using Woodward Park as anchor
   - Compare with Crystal Springs results
   - Identify courses where anchors disagree

6. **Create Calibration Application Workflow**
   - Review recommendations
   - Select which to apply
   - Update difficulty ratings
   - Log changes to audit table

### Future (AI Evolution)

7. **Implement Elite Concentration Metric**
   - Count athletes with normalized time < 32000 cs
   - Calculate percentage per course
   - Use as confidence factor

8. **Implement Network Centrality**
   - Count how many OTHER courses share athletes
   - Hub courses = better calibration anchors

9. **Automatic Anchor Promotion**
   - When course hits thresholds (confidence > 0.85, results > 500, seasons > 3)
   - Promote to anchor status
   - Add to multi-anchor weighted calibration

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Dual Anchor System âœ…
- **Primary:** Crystal Springs 2.95 miles = 1.0 (50 years validation)
- **Secondary:** Woodward Park 5000 meters = 0.95 (elite program usage)
- All others remain at calculated confidence

### 2. Single-Season Penalty âœ…
- Formula changed: Single season = 0.00 season contribution
- Max confidence for single-season: ~0.40
- Requires 5+ seasons for full 0.40 season credit

### 3. Recommendation Storage âœ…
- Don't auto-apply calibration results
- Save to `course_difficulty_recommendations` table
- Manual review required before applying

### 4. Athlete Improvement Model âœ…
- Performance-based (not fixed 1.5 sec/week)
- Elite: 1.0 sec/week
- Developing: 2.0-2.5 sec/week
- Girls: Unique patterns (plateau/decline)

## User Quotes (Context)

> "I need to go to bed. prepare the CLAUDE_PROMPT.md and all other markdown files needed. clean up the directories. commit and push everything"

**Translation:** End of session. Package everything for next session, clean up test files, commit work.

> "yes, it worked. We still need to refine the responses."

**Translation:** Calibration API working but results show distance-effect confounding issues we discussed.

> "Crystal and Woodward Park will continue to have the best runners on the course in large volume"

**Translation:** Elite runner self-selection validates course quality. System should learn from this pattern.

> "I am confident in the rankings for Crystal Springs 2.95 and Woodward Park, 5000 Meters. The rest of the courses are iffy"

**Translation:** Only 2 validated anchors. Everything else is single-season data with low confidence.
