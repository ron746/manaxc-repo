2. âœ… Enhance school records performances page with filtering
3. âœ… Add CIF metadata to school detail pages
4. âœ… Convert schools list page to checkbox-driven filters
5. âœ… Reorganize and enhance season page filters
6. âœ… Support null/blank value filtering across all pages

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Athletic Calendar Grade Calculation âœ…

**Problem:** Grade levels were calculated using calendar year instead of athletic season year (July 1 - June 30)

**Solution:** Implemented `getGrade()` helper function across all relevant pages

```typescript
const getGrade = (gradYear: number, meetDate: string) => {
  const meetYear = new Date(meetDate).getFullYear()
  const meetMonth = new Date(meetDate).getMonth()
  // Cross country season spans fall, so use next year if after June (month >= 6)
  const seasonYear = meetMonth >= 6 ? meetYear + 1 : meetYear
  return 12 - (gradYear - seasonYear)
}
```

**Impact:**
- Freshmen competing in August 2024 correctly show as freshmen (not 8th graders)
- Seniors competing in May 2025 correctly show as seniors (not post-graduates)
- Historical data now displays accurate grade levels

**Pages Fixed:**
- `/app/schools/[id]/records/page.tsx`
- `/app/schools/[id]/records/performances/page.tsx`
- `/app/courses/[id]/performances/page.tsx`

### 2. School Records Performances Page - Complete Rewrite âœ…

**Before:** No data displaying, using complex joins on results table

**After:** Fast, filtered view using optimized `school_course_records` table

**Key Features:**
- **Sidebar Layout:** 25% filters, 75% results table
- **Grade Level Filter:** FR, SO, JR, SR with Select All checkbox
- **Courses Filter:** All courses school competed on, with Select All
- **Pagination:** 50 results per page with navigation
- **Gender Toggle:** Boys/Girls selection buttons
- **Performance:** Pre-computed data loads instantly

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Load from optimized table
const { data: recordsData } = await supabase
  .from('school_course_records')
  .select('*')
  .eq('school_id', schoolId)
  .order('time_cs', { ascending: true })

// Recalculate grade using correct athletic calendar
const correctedGrade = record.athlete_grad_year && record.meet_date
  ? getGrade(record.athlete_grad_year, record.meet_date)
  : record.grade
```

**User Experience:**
- Filter by specific grades to see progression
- Filter by specific courses to compare performances
- Paginated view prevents overwhelming data display
- Clear separation between boys and girls results

### 3. School Detail Page - CIF Metadata Badges âœ…

**Enhancement:** Added visual badges for league/division information

**Badges Added:**
- **CIF Section** - Purple badge (e.g., "CCS", "NCS")
- **CIF Division** - Indigo badge (e.g., "Division I", "Division II")
- **League** - Cyan badge (e.g., "BVAL", "WCAL", "SCVAL")
- **Subleague** - Teal badge (e.g., "Mt Hamilton Division")

**Filter Reordering:**
- Gender filter moved above Graduation Year filter
- Rationale: Gender is more frequently used filter, graduation years grow long

**Visual Impact:**
- Immediate context about school's competitive classification
- Color-coded badges for easy visual scanning
- Professional, modern design aesthetic

### 4. Schools List Page - Checkbox Filter Enhancement âœ…

**Before:** Dropdown select menus, limited filtering options

**After:** Checkbox-driven multi-select with null value support

**Filter Implementation:**

1. **State â†’ CIF Section â†’ CIF Division â†’ League â†’ Subleague**
2. Each filter section includes:
   - Individual checkboxes for each value
   - "Select All" checkbox
   - "Blank/Unknown" checkbox with count (e.g., "(12)")
3. Set-based state management for efficient filtering
4. All filters positioned above schools list

**Technical Pattern:**
```typescript
// Filter logic with null support
const cifSectionMatch = selectedCifSections.size === 0 ||
  (school.cif_section && selectedCifSections.has(school.cif_section)) ||
  (!school.cif_section && includeCifSectionNulls)
```

**UI Pattern:**
```typescript
{blankCifSectionCount > 0 && (
  <label className="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={includeCifSectionNulls}
      onChange={(e) => setIncludeCifSectionNulls(e.target.checked)}
    />
    <span>Blank/Unknown ({blankCifSectionCount})</span>
  </label>
)}
```

**Additional Fix:**
- Search box text color changed to darker zinc-900 for better visibility

### 5. Season Page - Filter Reorganization âœ…

**Reorganized Filter Order:**

1. **Season Best or Personal Best** (Radio buttons)
2. **Project Times to Course** (Dropdown)
3. **Gender** (Boys/Girls checkboxes)
4. **CIF Section** (Checkboxes with Select All)
5. **CIF Division** (Checkboxes with Select All)
6. **League** (Checkboxes with Select All)
7. **Subleague** (Checkboxes with Select All)
8. **Schools** (Checkboxes with Select All)

**New CIF Metadata Filters:**
- All use Set-based state management
- All support Select All functionality
- All support null/blank value inclusion
- Blank counts calculated via useMemo for performance

**Database Confirmation:**
- Verified using `athlete_best_times` table (optimized)
- Query includes nested school metadata joins
- Fast performance due to indexed lookups

**Filter Logic:**
```typescript
const filteredAthletes = allAthletes.filter(athlete => {
  const cifSectionMatch = selectedCifSections.size === 0 ||
    (athlete.school_cif_section && selectedCifSections.has(athlete.school_cif_section)) ||
    (!athlete.school_cif_section && includeCifSectionNulls)
  // ... similar for division, league, subleague
  return selectedGenders.has(athlete.gender) &&
    cifSectionMatch && cifDivisionMatch && leagueMatch && subleagueMatch &&
    selectedSchools.has(athlete.school_id) && seasonCheck && selectedAthletes.has(athlete.id)
})
```

## Technical Architecture

### Database Tables Utilized

1. **school_course_records**
   - Pre-computed best performances per grade/course/gender
   - Includes all necessary athlete and meet metadata
   - Updated by database triggers when new results inserted
   - Eliminates need for complex joins at query time

2. **athlete_best_times**
   - Season-best and all-time best normalized times
   - Pre-computed for each athlete per season
   - Includes nested school metadata for filtering
   - Indexed for fast lookups

### State Management Pattern

**Set-based filtering:**
```typescript
const [selectedCifSections, setSelectedCifSections] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [includeCifSectionNulls, setIncludeCifSectionNulls] = useState(false)

// Empty Set = select all (no filtering)
// Non-empty Set = filter by values in set
// includeNulls flag = whether to include null values
```

**Benefits:**
- O(1) membership checking
- Easy add/remove operations
- Consistent pattern across all filters
- TypeScript type safety

### Performance Optimizations

1. **useMemo for derived values:**
   - Unique filter values calculated once
   - Blank counts calculated once
   - Filtered results only recalculated when dependencies change

2. **Pre-computed tables:**
   - No complex joins at query time
   - Database triggers maintain data freshness
   - Indexed lookups for fast filtering

3. **Efficient rendering:**
   - Pagination prevents rendering thousands of rows
   - Conditional rendering of filter sections
   - Lazy evaluation of filter matches
