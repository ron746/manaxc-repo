- Create first database tables
- Insert Westmont school data
- Test database connection from local machine

**Notes:**
- Ron is highly motivated and has deep domain expertise
- Course standardization is the key differentiator
- Athletic.net data availability is crucial - need to validate scraping feasibility
- Keep scope ruthlessly tight - no feature creep
- Ron already has all major services configured - ahead of schedule!
