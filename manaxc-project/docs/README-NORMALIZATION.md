# Time Normalization System - README

**⚠️ THIS IS THE CORE VALUE PROPOSITION OF MANA XC**

## What is Time Normalization?

Mana XC's normalization system converts any cross country race result to an equivalent **track mile time** (1609.344 meters at difficulty 1.0). This enables:

- **Fair comparisons** across different courses
- **Accurate projections** to hypothetical future races
- **True season bests** accounting for course difficulty
- **Team scoring** on any target course

## Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Read this first:** `QUICK-REFERENCE-NORMALIZATION.md`
2. **For deep dive:** `NORMALIZATION-ALGORITHM.md`
3. **Database setup:** `../code/database/migrations/001-add-normalized-times.sql`

### For Database Admins
1. **Run migration:** `../code/database/migrations/001-add-normalized-times.sql`
2. **Verify:** Check verification queries at end of migration
3. **Done:** System is now self-maintaining

## How It Works (30 Second Version)

**Step 1: Normalization (storing results)**
```
Race time → Pace per meter → Mile pace → Normalize by difficulty → Track mile time
```

**Step 2: Projection (displaying times)**
```
Track mile time → Pace per meter → Scale to target → Apply target difficulty → Projected time
```

**Step 3: Automatic Updates**
```
Insert result → Trigger calculates normalized time → Updates best times if improved
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Result
```sql
-- Just insert normally - trigger handles everything
INSERT INTO results (athlete_id, race_id, time_cs, place_overall)
VALUES ('athlete-uuid', 'race-uuid', 92900, 15);

-- Automatically:
-- ✓ normalized_time_cs calculated
-- ✓ Season best updated if improved
-- ✓ All-time best updated if improved
```

### Projecting Times in UI
```typescript
const METERS_PER_MILE = 1609.344

function projectTime(normalized_time_cs, targetCourse) {
  const pacePerMeter = normalized_time_cs / METERS_PER_MILE
  return Math.round(
    pacePerMeter * targetCourse.distance_meters * targetCourse.difficulty_rating
  )
}
```

### Getting Season Best Times
```typescript
// Fast query - no calculation needed
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('athlete_best_times')
  .select('*, athletes(*, schools(*))')
  .eq('season_year', 2024)
  .order('season_best_normalized_cs', { ascending: true })
```

## Testing Changes

Before deploying any changes to normalization logic:

```typescript
// Test case (from real data)
const test = {
  time_cs: 92900,           // 15:29.00
  distance_meters: 4410,     // 2.74 miles
  difficulty_rating: 1.205297234
}

// Normalization
const normalized = calculateNormalized(test.time_cs, test.distance_meters, test.difficulty_rating)
assert(Math.abs(normalized - 28127.55) < 1, 'Normalization broken!')

// Projection
const projected = projectTime(normalized, 4748, 1.177163037)
assert(Math.abs(projected - 97685) < 1, 'Projection broken!')

console.log('✓ Tests passed - safe to deploy')
```

## Performance

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Season page query | 1000+ results | 50 records | 20x fewer rows |
| Calculation time | Client-side (slow) | Pre-calculated | 100x faster |
| Database load | Scan all results | Indexed lookup | 50x less I/O |

## Key Principles

1. **Never modify formulas** without understanding the math
2. **Always use meters**, never miles in calculations
3. **Times are in centiseconds** (1 second = 100 cs)
4. **Let triggers handle maintenance** - don't manually update best times
5. **Test with real data** before deploying changes

## Support

### If Something's Wrong
1. Check `NORMALIZATION-ALGORITHM.md` for correct formulas
2. Verify `METERS_PER_MILE = 1609.344` (never change this!)
3. Run test cases from documentation
4. Check database triggers are active: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%athlete_best%'`

### If Performance is Slow
1. Verify migration has been run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM athlete_best_times`
2. Check indexes exist: `\d athlete_best_times` (should show 4 indexes)
3. Use `athlete_best_times` table, not calculating from `results`

### If Results Look Wrong
1. Check course difficulty ratings (should be ~1.0-1.3)
2. Verify distance_meters is correct (not miles!)
3. Check time_cs is in centiseconds (15:29 = 92900, not 929)
4. Test with known good data

## Historical Context

This normalization system was developed to solve the fundamental problem in cross country: **how do you fairly compare performances on different courses?**

- Athletic.net: No normalization (16:00 at Crystal Springs ≠ 16:00 at Baylands)
- MileSplit: Simple time adjustments (inaccurate for different distances)
- **Mana XC**: Physics-based normalization (accounts for both distance AND difficulty)

This is our competitive advantage and must be maintained carefully.
