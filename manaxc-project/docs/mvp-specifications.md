**Launch Team:** Westmont High School Cross Country

---

## MVP Philosophy

**"Information Only, Maximum Value"**

No training plans. No payment processing. No complicated features.

Just: **The best damn way to see how your XC team is performing.**

---

## Core Features (Must Have)

### 1. Course Standardization System ‚≠ê FLAGSHIP FEATURE

**What It Does:**
Converts any XC race result on any course to a standardized track mile equivalent.

**Why It Matters:**
- Athletes can compare performances across different courses
- Coaches can rank athletes fairly
- College recruiters can evaluate talent across the country
- Predicts performance on new courses

**MVP Requirements:**
- [ ] Database of 50+ California high school XC courses with difficulty ratings
- [ ] Algorithm that converts 5K XC time ‚Üí equivalent track mile time
- [ ] Display standardized time alongside actual race time on all athlete profiles
- [ ] Course difficulty visualized (1.0-2.0 scale, typical XC: 1.10-1.25, where 1.0 = track mile baseline)

**Example:**
```
Athlete: Sarah Johnson
Race: Crystal Springs 5K (Difficulty: 1.177 - Rolling hills)
Actual Time: 19:30
Standardized Mile: 5:45
```

**Algorithm Inputs:**
1. Actual race time
2. Course distance (3 miles, 5K, etc.)
3. Course difficulty rating (elevation gain, terrain, altitude)
4. Weather conditions (optional for MVP)

**Algorithm Output:**
- Standardized track mile equivalent
- Confidence interval (¬±5 seconds)

**Data Sources for Course Ratings:**

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Not Building Yet, But Keep in Mind)

**Phase 2 Features (Months 2-6):**
- Multi-team support (WCAL league, then all of California)
- Training plan generator (AI-powered)
- Workout logging
- Payment processing ($3/month athletes, $50/month teams)
- Advanced analytics (VO2 max, race simulation)

**Phase 3 Features (Months 7-12):**
- Track & field expansion
- Social features (following, commenting)
- College recruiting tools
- Mobile app push notifications
- Calendar/event coordination

---

## Open Questions (Need to Decide)

1. **Course Difficulty Algorithm:** 
   - Use simple heuristic (elevation gain + distance) or ML model?
   - How to handle weather/conditions?
   - Decision: Start simple, refine with data

2. **Data Privacy:**
   - Are athlete profiles public or require login?
   - Do parents need to consent for minors?
   - Decision: Public profiles (like Athletic.net), add privacy settings post-MVP

3. **Mobile App Platform:**
   - iOS only, Android only, or both?
   - Decision: Both via React Native/Expo

4. **Manual Data Entry:**
   - How does coach add new race results?
   - CSV upload? Web form? Auto-scrape Athletic.net?
   - Decision: Web form for MVP, auto-scrape in Phase 2
