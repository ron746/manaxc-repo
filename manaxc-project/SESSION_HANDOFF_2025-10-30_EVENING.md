# Session Handoff - October 30, 2025 (Evening)

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Course Calibration System
**Problem:** Both AI analysis and network calibration had issues
**Status:** FIXED and WORKING

#### 1. AI Course Analysis - Logic Flaw Fixed
**File:** `website/app/api/admin/ai-course-analysis/route.ts`

**What was wrong:**
- Compared courses to AVERAGE of ALL other courses (circular reasoning)
- If all courses miscalibrated, saw no problem

**What was fixed:**
- Now uses Malcolm Slaney's anchor-based method correctly
- Compares ONLY to Crystal Springs anchor course
- Uses performance ratios (not time differences)
- Applied SQL optimization: 1000+ queries → 1 query

**Performance:** 60+ seconds → 3-5 seconds

#### 2. Network Calibration - Performance Fixed
**File:** `website/app/api/admin/network-course-calibration-optimized/route.ts`

**What was wrong:**
- Logic was CORRECT but had severe performance issues
- Nested loops: 26,000+ queries
- Never completed, hung indefinitely at 126% CPU

**What was fixed:**
- Created SQL function `get_all_course_calibrations()`
- Single query processes all courses in parallel
- Fixed type mismatch (numeric vs double precision)
- Fixed field name mismatch (shared_athlete_count)

**Performance:** Never completes → 5-10 seconds

#### 3. SQL Migrations Applied
**Files:**
- `20251030_optimize_course_analysis_CORRECTED.sql` ✅
- `20251030_fix_type_mismatch.sql` ✅

**Functions Created:**
- `get_athlete_course_comparisons_anchor_based()` - For AI analysis
- `get_all_course_calibrations()` - For network calibration
- `get_course_calibration_stats()` - For pairwise comparison

### ✅ COMPLETE: Recommendation Storage System

**User Request:** Don't auto-apply changes; save recommendations to review later

**Implementation Complete:**
1. ✅ New table: `course_difficulty_recommendations` - Migration created
2. ✅ Network calibration saves (doesn't apply) recommendations
3. ✅ AI analysis saves (doesn't apply) recommendations
4. ✅ Course analysis page shows both network + AI recommendations side-by-side
5. ✅ Manual approve/dismiss on course-by-course basis
6. ✅ Audit trail of what was applied when
7. ✅ API endpoint for fetching and managing recommendations

**See:** `RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` for full documentation and testing instructions

## Key Technical Details

### Malcolm Slaney's Method (Correctly Implemented Now)

**Anchor Course:** Crystal Springs, 2.95 Miles
- **Difficulty rating:** 1.177163037 (17.7% harder than flat track)
- **Network ratio:** 1.0 (comparing to itself)

**For other courses:**
```typescript
For each shared athlete:
  ratio = (their median time on TARGET) / (their median time on ANCHOR)

median_ratio = median(all ratios)
implied_difficulty = current_difficulty × median_ratio

// Example: North Monterey County
// Ratio 0.89 = athletes run 89% of their anchor time
// Implied: 1.225 × 0.89 = 1.090 (11% easier than currently rated)
```

### Gender-Specific Patterns (From Documentation)

**Boys:** Consistent improvement (~10.5 sec/month, ~15.2 sec/year)
**Girls:** HIGHLY VARIABLE due to puberty
- Early developers may peak as FR/SO
- Late developers improve as JR/SR
- DO NOT assume linear improvement

The anchor-based method accounts for this naturally through median ratios.

### Current Test Results

**Network Calibration Working:**
- 23 courses analyzed
- 5 need review (>5% discrepancy)
- Top recommendations:
  - Lagoon Valley Park: -27.2% (needs to be easier)
  - Crystal Springs 2.13mi: -17.9%
  - North Monterey County: -7.8%

**Issues Found:**
- Shared athlete counts showing correctly now
- Confidence scores calculating properly
- BUT: "Total Results: 0" for anchor course suggests data issue?

## Next Session TODO

### Priority 1: Testing Recommendation System
1. [ ] Apply database migration for recommendations table
2. [ ] Run network calibration and verify recommendations saved
3. [ ] Test Apply workflow - verify course difficulty updates
4. [ ] Test Dismiss workflow - verify recommendation marked dismissed
5. [ ] Run AI analysis on a few courses
6. [ ] Compare network vs AI recommendations side-by-side
7. [ ] Apply 2-3 high-confidence recommendations
8. [ ] Verify imported meet results use new normalized times

### Priority 2: Validation
1. [ ] Check why anchor course shows "0 results"
2. [ ] Verify Crystal Springs has data in database
3. [ ] Test with known courses to validate recommendations
4. [ ] Compare results to your coaching intuition

### Priority 3: Documentation
1. [ ] Update CLAUDE_PROMPT.md with recommendation system
2. [ ] Create user guide for recommendation workflow
3. [ ] Document database schema changes

## Important Context

### Course Difficulty Scale
- **1.0** = Flat track (baseline)
- **1.177** = Crystal Springs (17.7% harder per mile than track)
- **1.0-1.15** = Typical HS XC courses
- **>1.3** = Very difficult courses

### Baseline Confusion
- **Malcolm Slaney's scale:** Crystal Springs = 1.0 (his anchor)
- **Our scale:** Crystal Springs = 1.177 (relative to flat track)
- We use his METHOD, not his numeric scale

### Network Calibration Anchor
- **Crystal Springs = anchor** for comparing courses
- **Ratio = 1.0** when comparing to itself (as expected)
- Other courses get ratios relative to Crystal Springs

## Testing Instructions

### Test Network Calibration:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/network-calibration
2. Click "Run Calibration"
3. Should complete in 5-10 seconds
4. Check "Needs Review" tab
5. Verify shared athlete counts and confidence scores display

### Test AI Course Analysis (Once Implemented):
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/course-analysis
2. Select a course with many results
3. Click "Analyze with Claude"
4. Should complete in 3-5 seconds
5. Review recommendation and reasoning

## Known Issues

1. **Anchor course "Total Results: 0"** - Need to investigate if Crystal Springs has results data
2. **Old endpoint still exists** - Consider removing `/api/admin/network-course-calibration` (the slow one)
3. **Dev server restarts needed** - Type changes may require clearing .next cache

## Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
cd /Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/website
npm run dev

# Check server logs
tail -f /tmp/nextjs.log

# Kill hung processes
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

## Critical Reminders

1. **Always use anchor-based comparison** - comparing to average of all courses is WRONG
2. **Don't auto-apply recommendations** - save for manual review first
3. **Account for gender patterns** - girls' improvement is highly variable
4. **Crystal Springs = 1.177** - this is correct (17.7% harder than track)
