## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Static Export vs Server-Side Rendering
**Decision:** Use Next.js static export mode
**Reason:** Simpler deployment to Cloudflare Pages, better performance for read-heavy site
**Trade-off:** Data is fetched client-side, stats are loaded after page load

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials vs Environment Variables
**Decision:** Hardcode Supabase credentials in client.ts
**Reason:** Environment variables don't work in browser with static export
**Security:** Supabase anon key is designed to be public; security comes from Row Level Security policies

### 3. GitHub Account
**Decision:** Use ron746 instead of ron681
**Reason:** User requested to use correct account for this project

## Commits Made This Session

1. **Initial commit:** ManaXC.com landing page
   - Next.js setup with Supabase integration

2. **Configure Next.js for static export**
   - Fixed 404 errors on Cloudflare Pages

3. **Fix Supabase credentials for static export**
   - Added fallback values for environment variables

4. **Remove environment variable check**
   - Hardcoded credentials directly (final fix)

---

## What's NOT Done Yet (Next Steps)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Import Data:**
   - Import first race data using existing importers
   - Populate database with real athlete/course/result data
   - Test that stats update on website

2. **Build Missing Pages:**
   - `/meets` - List of all meets
   - `/schools` - List of schools and teams
   - `/courses` - List of courses and venues
   - `/meets/[id]` - Individual meet detail page
   - `/athletes/[id]` - Individual athlete profile
   - `/courses/[id]` - Individual course detail page

3. **Admin Tools:**
   - Build admin import workflow (from ADMIN_IMPORT_WORKFLOW.md)
   - Create UI for single race import
   - Add course difficulty management interface

### Future Enhancements
- Search functionality
- Filtering and sorting
- Performance comparisons
- Season statistics
- PR tracking
- Meet results analysis

- **Database:** Cleaned and ready for new data

### Cloudflare Pages

- **Build Output:** `/out`
- **Framework:** Next.js (static export)
- **Auto-deploys:** On push to main branch

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Static Export:** Stats are fetched client-side, not at build time
2. **No Authentication:** Site is fully public (as designed for v1.0)
3. **No Admin Interface:** Must use SQL or scripts to manage data
4. **Missing Pages:** Only landing page built, other pages return 404

### Technical Debt
- Should implement proper environment variable handling for future dynamic rendering
- Consider moving back to SSR if real-time data updates are needed
- Need to add proper error boundaries and loading states

---

## Database Schema (Current)

### Tables with Data
- **schools:** 1 record (Westmont High School)

### Empty Tables (Ready for Import)
- **athletes:** 0 records
- **courses:** 0 records
- **venues:** 0 records (if created)
- **meets:** 0 records
- **races:** 0 records
- **results:** 0 records
- **difficulty_presets:** 6 records (Fast, Easy, Average, Moderate, Hard, Slow)

---

## Development Environment

### Local Development
```bash
cd /Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/website
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Deployment
- Automatic on git push to main branch
- Manual redeploy available in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Build time: ~40-50 seconds
- Deploy time: ~10-15 seconds

---

## Session Duration

**Start:** Continued from previous session (context limit)
**End:** Website fully deployed and functional
**Total Time:** ~2-3 hours

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Test manaxc.com thoroughly** - Verify all features work
2. **Import first race data** - Use existing importers to populate database
3. **Build /meets page** - List all meets from database
4. **Build meet detail page** - Show individual meet with races and results
5. **Add search functionality** - Allow users to search for athletes/schools

---

## For Next Claude Session

**Start with:** "I'm continuing the ManaXC project. The website is deployed at https://manaxc.com. Please read SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-25.md and START-NEXT-SESSION.md to understand where we are."

**Key Context Files:**
- This file (SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-25.md)
- START-NEXT-SESSION.md
- CURRENT-STATUS.md
- /website/README.md
- /code/importers/ADMIN_IMPORT_WORKFLOW.md

## Final Notes

The website deployment was successful after solving several technical challenges related to static export and environment variables. The site is now live and ready for data import and feature expansion.

The codebase is clean, well-organized, and ready for the next phase of development.

**Status:** âœ… WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE
