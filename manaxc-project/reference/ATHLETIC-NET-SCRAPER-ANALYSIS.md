## Overview

This is a **sophisticated web scraper** that extracts cross country results from Athletic.net (the industry standard results platform).

### What It Does
1. Takes a school ID and season (e.g., Westmont 1076, season 2025)
2. Visits the school's Athletic.net season page
3. Finds all meets for that season
4. Scrapes every race result from each meet
5. Converts times to **centiseconds** ✅
6. Outputs CSV + JSON files
7. **Detects duplicates** (won't re-scrape existing meets)

---

## Key Features (Why This Is Excellent)

### 1. **Puppeteer-Based (Smart Choice)**
```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: true,
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
});
```

**Why this matters:**
- Athletic.net is an **Angular SPA** (Single Page Application)
- Regular HTTP requests won't work (no HTML in response)
- Puppeteer = Headless Chrome browser
- Waits for JavaScript to render the page
- Gets the ACTUAL rendered HTML

**Alternative approaches would fail:**
- ❌ `fetch()` - Returns empty Angular shell
- ❌ `axios` - Same problem
- ❌ `cheerio` - Can't execute JavaScript
- ✅ **Puppeteer** - Only thing that works

### 2. **Time Conversion to Centiseconds** ✅
```javascript
function parseTimeToCs(timeStr) {
    const parts = timeStr.match(/(\d+):(\d+)(\.\d+)?/);
    const minutes = parseInt(parts[1], 10);
    const seconds = parseInt(parts[2], 10);
    const centiseconds = parts[3] ? Math.round(parseFloat(parts[3]) * 100) : 0;
    return minutes * 6000 + seconds * 100 + centiseconds;
}
```

**Converts:** "19:30.45" → 117045 centiseconds

**Perfect alignment with ADR-001!** ✅

### 3. **Smart Name Parsing**
```javascript
function splitFullName(fullName) {
    const cleanName = fullName.trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
    const parts = cleanName.split(' ');
    if (parts.length === 1) return { firstName: parts[0], lastName: '' };
    const lastName = parts.pop() || '';
    const firstName = parts.join(' ');
    return { firstName, lastName };
}
```

**Handles:**
- "John Smith" → First: John, Last: Smith
- "Mary Jane Wilson" → First: Mary Jane, Last: Wilson
- "Prince" (single name) → First: Prince, Last: ""

Simple and works for most cases.

### 4. **Duplicate Detection** ⭐ CRITICAL FEATURE
```javascript
// Check for existing data
const jsonFile = `athletic-net-${schoolId}-${season}.json`;
let existingMeetIds = new Set();

if (fs.existsSync(jsonFile)) {
    const existingData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(jsonFile, 'utf8'));
    existingMeetIds = new Set(existingData.map(meet => meet.meetId));
}

// Filter out already-scraped meets
const newMeetIds = pageData.meetIds.filter(id => !existingMeetIds.has(id));
```

**Why this is genius:**
- Run scraper weekly during season
- Only scrapes NEW meets
- Doesn't waste time re-scraping old data
- Appends to existing CSV/JSON
- Fast incremental updates

### 5. **Rate Limiting (Good Citizen)**
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Be nice to server
```

**2-second delay between meets** - Won't hammer Athletic.net's servers.

### 6. **Robust Error Handling**
```javascript
try {
    await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2', timeout: 30000 });
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 4000)); // Wait for Angular
    // ... scrape logic
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`    ❌ Error: ${error.message}`);
    return null;
} finally {
    await page.close();
}
```

**Features:**
- 30-second timeout
- 4-second wait for Angular to render
- Graceful failure (skips bad meets, continues)
- Always closes browser page (no memory leaks)

### 7. **Data Extraction Logic**

**Scrapes:**
- Meet name (from page title)
- Meet date (from page text or JSON-LD)
- Location (from Google Maps link)
- Race name (from headers)
- Gender (M/F from "Mens Results" / "Womens Results")
- Results table (place, grade, name, time, school)

**Smart traversal:**
```javascript
// Finds gender sections (Mens/Womens)
const genderHeaders = document.querySelectorAll('h4');

// For each gender, finds race headers (h5)
const raceHeaders = container.querySelectorAll('h5');

// For each race, finds the DataTable
const foundTable = nextEl.querySelector('table.DataTable');
```

**Why this works:**
- Athletic.net has consistent structure
- Gender → Race → Table hierarchy
- Code mirrors the HTML structure

  {
    "meetId": "123456",
    "meetName": "WCAL Championships",
    "date": "Nov 2, 2024",
    "location": "Crystal Springs",
    "races": [
      {
        "raceId": "789",
        "raceName": "Varsity",
        "gender": "M",
        "results": [
          {
            "place": 1,
            "grade": 12,
            "fullName": "John Smith",
            "time": "16:45.32",
            "school": "Westmont"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual Use (Week 2-3)
**While building app:**
- Run scraper manually for 2024, 2025 seasons
- Import CSV files via import wizard
- Get all historical data

### Phase 2: Scheduled Updates (Week 4-6)
**During XC season:**
- Run scraper weekly (GitHub Actions cron job)
- New meets get automatically scraped
- CSV files auto-import to database
- Keep data fresh during active season

### Phase 3: Admin UI (Month 2-3)
**For Ron:**
- Button in admin dashboard: "Update from Athletic.net"
- Runs scraper in background
- Shows progress (new meets found)
- Auto-imports results
- One-click data refresh

---

## When to Use This Scraper

### ✅ Use For:
1. **Historical data import** (backfill 2022-2025)
2. **Weekly updates during season** (new meets)
3. **Other schools** (when expanding beyond Westmont)
4. **Validation** (compare with Ron's Excel data)

### ❌ Don't Use For:
1. **Initial Westmont data** (use Excel file - it's already compiled!)
2. **Real-time updates** (scraper takes 5-10 minutes)
3. **Individual meet lookups** (too slow, use saved data)

---

## Recommended Timeline

### Day 2-4: Use Excel Data ✅
- Import Ron's existing Excel file
- Get 58 years of data instantly
- Start building features immediately

### Day 5-6: Copy Scraper ✅
- Copy `athletic-net-scraper-v2.js` to new project
- Test with one school/season
- Verify output matches expectations
- Document how to run it

### Week 2-3: Scrape Recent Data
- Run for Westmont 2024, 2025
- Compare with Excel data (validation)
- Fill in any gaps
- Test duplicate detection

### Week 4+: Automate Updates
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- Run weekly during season
- Auto-import new results
- Monitor for errors

## Potential Improvements (Future)

### Low Priority (Works Fine As-Is)
1. ~~Duplicate detection~~ ✅ Already implemented
2. ~~Time conversion~~ ✅ Already implemented
3. ~~Rate limiting~~ ✅ Already implemented

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Progress indicators** - Show % complete during scraping
2. **Resume capability** - If scraper crashes, resume from last meet
3. **Parallel scraping** - Scrape multiple meets simultaneously (faster)
4. **Better date parsing** - Handle more date formats

### High Priority (If Scaling)
1. **Multi-school batching** - Scrape all WCAL schools at once
2. **Change detection** - Only import if results changed
3. **Error notifications** - Email/Slack if scraper fails
4. **Data validation** - Check for suspicious times (5-minute 5Ks)

---

## Technical Debt Notes

### Known Issues (Not Critical)
1. **4-second hard wait** - Could use smarter wait-for-element
2. **Traversal logic is fragile** - If Athletic.net changes HTML, breaks
3. **No retry logic** - If one meet fails, skips it entirely
4. **Name parsing is basic** - Struggles with "Jr.", "III", etc.

### Mitigation
- ✅ These issues are **acceptable for MVP**
- ✅ Scraper works well enough 95% of the time
- ✅ Manual fixes for edge cases are fine initially
- ⏳ Can improve later if scaling to hundreds of schools

## Comparison to Alternatives

### Why Not Use Athletic.net API?
**There isn't one.** Athletic.net doesn't provide a public API.

Options:
1. ✅ **Web scraping** (what we do) - Free, works, legally gray area
2. ❌ **Partnership with Athletic.net** - Would require $$$, legal agreements
3. ❌ **Manual entry** - Too slow, error-prone

### Why Puppeteer vs. Alternatives?

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Puppeteer** | Works with SPAs, full browser | Slower, heavy | ✅ Best choice |
| Playwright | Similar to Puppeteer | Overkill for this | ⚠️ Alternative |
| Selenium | Cross-browser testing | Even slower | ❌ Too heavy |
| Cheerio | Fast, lightweight | Can't run JavaScript | ❌ Won't work |
| Axios/Fetch | Very fast | Can't render SPAs | ❌ Won't work |

**Verdict:** Puppeteer is the right tool for this job.

---

## Legal & Ethical Notes

### Is This Legal?
**Probably yes, but gray area:**
- Athletic.net data is publicly viewable (no login required)
- We're not bypassing paywalls
- We're not reselling their data
- We're adding value (course standardization)
- Similar to Google indexing websites

**BUT:**
- Athletic.net could send cease & desist
- Could block scraper IPs
- Could change HTML structure (break scraper)

### Ethical Considerations
**We're being good citizens:**
- ✅ Rate limiting (2-second delays)
- ✅ Proper user agent
- ✅ Don't hammer their servers
- ✅ Cache results (don't re-scrape)
- ✅ Use data to benefit coaches/athletes (not harm Athletic.net)

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Don't scrape excessively** - Weekly updates only
2. **Have backup plan** - Excel data, manual entry
3. **Add value** - Our course standardization is unique
4. **Eventually partner?** - If we grow, negotiate with Athletic.net

## Recommendation

### ✅ KEEP THIS SCRAPER

**Reasons:**
1. **It works** - Battle-tested, handles Angular SPAs
2. **Smart features** - Duplicate detection, rate limiting, centiseconds
3. **Time savings** - Automates what would take hours manually
4. **Future-proof** - Can scrape other schools when expanding

### Copy to New Project (Day 5-6)
