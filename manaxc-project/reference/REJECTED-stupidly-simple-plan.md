# Mana XC: The Stupidly Simple Plan
**For:** 1 person with 2 full-time jobs  
**Goal:** First paying customer in 90 days, $1K/month in 6 months  
**Strategy:** Build the MINIMUM, charge early, expand slowly

---

## The One Thing That Matters

**Course Difficulty Calculator = Your Moat**

Everything else is a distraction. Focus 100% on this until it prints money.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-2) - 10 hours total

### Week 1 (5 hours)
**Goal:** Validate someone will pay

**Actions:**
1. Create simple Google Form survey
2. Send to Westmont XC team + 5 other local coaches
3. Ask: "Would you pay $30/season for accurate course difficulty rankings?"
4. If 3+ say yes → proceed
5. If not → pivot or kill project

**Deliverable:** Written commitments from 3 coaches

---

### Week 2 (5 hours)  
**Goal:** Set up basic infrastructure

**Actions:**
1. Buy domain: manaxc.com (done ✅)
2. Set up Carrd.co (free/cheap no-code website)
3. Create 1-page site:
   - "Course Difficulty Calculator - Coming Soon"
   - Email signup form
   - Screenshot of what it will look like
4. Post link in local XC Facebook groups

**Deliverable:** Live landing page with email list

---

## Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 3-8) - 40 hours total

### The ONLY Feature You Build
**Course Difficulty Calculator (web-based, simple)**

**What it does:**
1. User enters: Athlete name, time, course name
2. System converts time to "standard mile equivalent"
3. Shows: "This 17:45 at Crystal Springs = 5:32 mile"

**What it DOESN'T do:**
- No login (just use it)
- No mobile app
- No training plans
- No team management
- No fancy design
- No athlete profiles
- No race calendar
- No social features

### Tech Stack (the lazy way)
- **Frontend:** Google Sheets + Google Apps Script (seriously)
- **Alt Frontend:** Carrd.co with Airtable (if you hate Sheets)
- **Database:** One Google Sheet with 3 tabs:
  - Tab 1: Course ratings (manual entry)
  - Tab 2: Calculator form responses
  - Tab 3: Conversion formulas

**Why this works:**
- Zero coding needed
- Works on mobile automatically
- You already know Google Sheets
- Can upgrade later if it makes money

### Week 3-4 (10 hours): Build Calculator v0.1
1. Create Google Sheet with 10 local courses
2. Research/estimate course difficulty ratings
3. Build conversion formula (time_seconds / course_difficulty = standard_mile)
4. Create Google Form that feeds the sheet
5. Test with 10 Westmont athletes

### Week 5-6 (10 hours): Validate & Refine
1. Have Westmont athletes use it for 2 weeks
2. Collect feedback
3. Fix obvious issues
4. Add 10 more courses (20 total)

### Week 7-8 (20 hours): Productize
1. Make it not look like garbage (basic styling)
2. Add share buttons (athletes share their conversions)
3. Create 2-minute demo video
4. Write simple instructions

**Deliverable:** Working calculator with 20 courses

---

## Phase 2: First Dollar (Weeks 9-12) - 20 hours total

### Week 9: The Westmont Deal
**Offer to Westmont (your school):**
- Free for season 1
- In exchange: testimonial + feedback + referrals
- Exclusive: Add any course they race on immediately

**Goal:** Get buy-in, prove value, get referral to 1 paying school

### Week 10-11: Sales (the hard part)
**Target:** 5 nearby XC programs

**The pitch (literally send this email):**
```
Subject: Free course difficulty calculator for [School Name] XC

Hi Coach [Name],

I'm Coach Ron at Westmont. I built a simple tool that converts XC times 
across different courses to a standard mile equivalent.

Example: 17:45 at Crystal Springs = 5:32 mile
         18:10 at Montgomery Hill = 5:34 mile
         (tells you Montgomery is slower course)

Free trial for your team this season. $30 total if you like it.

Want to try it?

-Ron
[Link to calculator]
```

**Outreach:**
- 5 emails per week
- Follow up once
- That's it

**Goal:** 1 paying customer ($30)

### Week 12: Lock It In
1. Get payment from 1 school ($30)
2. Deliver on promise
3. Ask for referral to 2 more coaches

**Deliverable:** $30 in revenue, 1 testimonial

---

## Phase 3: Scale to $1K/month (Months 4-6) - 60 hours total

### Month 4: Add 10 Paying Teams
**Math:** 10 teams × $30/season × 2 seasons (XC + Track) = $600/year

**Strategy:**
- Each paying customer refers 2 others (give $10 referral credit)
- Focus on one league/conference (they all race same courses)
- Attend 1 local meet, demo the tool to coaches

**New feature:** Team dashboard (still Google Sheets)
- Shows all team members' converted times
- Ranks team members by "true ability" not just race results

### Month 5: Add Athletes ($3/month)
**Athlete tier:** 
- $3/month or $25/year
- Tracks their progression over time
- Shows improvement in "true mile" even if race times plateau

**Sales:** 
- Westmont team first (30 athletes × $3 = $90/month)
- Other teams' athletes see it, sign up themselves

### Month 6: Hit $1K/month
**Revenue breakdown:**
- 20 team subscriptions × $30 × 2 seasons = $1,200/year ($100/month avg)
- 300 athlete subscriptions × $3/month = $900/month
- **Total: $1,000/month recurring**

---

## What You're NOT Building (Yet)

Save these for when you're making $5K/month:

❌ Mobile app  
❌ Custom website (Carrd works fine)  
❌ Training plans  
❌ Team management features  
❌ Race calendar  
❌ Social features  
❌ Automated scraping  
❌ AI anything  
❌ College recruiting features  

**Rule:** If it doesn't directly help convert times or make money, it waits.

---

## Time Budget Reality Check

**Your weekly availability:** ~5-10 hours (be honest)

**Phase 0:** 2 weeks × 5 hours = 10 hours  
**Phase 1:** 6 weeks × 7 hours = 40 hours  
**Phase 2:** 4 weeks × 5 hours = 20 hours  
**Phase 3:** 12 weeks × 5 hours = 60 hours  

**Total:** 130 hours over 6 months = 5 hours/week average

**That's doable.**

---

## Your Weekly Schedule

**Monday:** Nothing (coaching day)  
**Tuesday:** Nothing (coaching day)  
**Wednesday:** Nothing (coaching day)  
**Thursday:** 2 hours after work  
**Friday:** Nothing (rest)  
**Saturday:** 3 hours morning  
**Sunday:** Nothing (family time)  

**Total: 5 hours/week**

## How to Not Fail

### Rule 1: Don't Build Shit Nobody Wants
Before you build ANYTHING:
1. Show mockup to 3 coaches
2. Ask: "Would you pay $30 for this?"
3. If they say no, ask why
4. Fix that thing
5. Ask again

### Rule 2: Don't Build Until You Sell
Before you build:
1. Create landing page with fake "Buy Now" button
2. Button goes to "Coming soon" page with email signup
3. Track how many people click
4. If <5% click, your offer sucks
5. Fix offer, not product

### Rule 3: Charge Money Early
- Free users give fake feedback
- Paying customers tell the truth
- Charge something, even $10
- "I'd pay for that" ≠ actually paying

### Rule 4: Do Things That Don't Scale
- Manually enter course ratings? DO IT.
- Manually email results? DO IT.
- Manually onboard each team? DO IT.
- Personal text to every athlete? DO IT.

Automate at $5K/month, not before.

### Rule 5: Your Time is Sacred
If it takes >2 hours and doesn't:
1. Get a paying customer, or
2. Keep a paying customer happy

**Don't do it.**

## The Honest Path

### If This is Easy (It Won't Be)
- Month 3: First $100/month → Keep going
- Month 6: $1K/month → Quit banking job? Nah, keep going
- Month 12: $5K/month → Now we're talking
- Month 24: $10K/month → Hire someone part-time
- Year 3: $25K/month → This is your retirement fund

### If This is Hard (It Will Be)
- Month 3: No paying customers → Pivot or kill
- Month 6: <$500/month → Side project forever, don't scale
- Month 12: $1K/month → Good side income, don't quit day job

### If You Quit (You Might)
- Month 2: Burned out, overwhelmed → Take 2 weeks off
- Month 4: Stuck at $0 revenue → Talk to 10 more coaches
- Month 6: No traction → Write retrospective, move on

**It's okay to fail. Just fail fast.**

## The Starting Gun

### This Week (Next 7 Days):
1. Send validation survey to 5 coaches (1 hour)
2. Buy Carrd.co subscription ($19/year) (5 minutes)
3. Create 1-page landing site (2 hours)
4. Post link in 3 XC Facebook groups (30 minutes)
5. Create Google Sheet with 10 course ratings (1 hour)

**Total time: 5 hours**

### If you don't do this in 7 days, kill the project.

You're either serious or you're not. Hormozi would say: "If you can't spend 5 hours this week on something you claim is your future, you're lying to yourself."

---

## Your Decision Point

**Option A:** Start this week → Set calendar reminder for 1 hour on Saturday  
**Option B:** Not ready → Be honest, kill project, save yourself the stress  
**Option C:** Modify the plan → Tell me what's wrong, we'll fix it  

**What's it gonna be?**

**End of Plan**
