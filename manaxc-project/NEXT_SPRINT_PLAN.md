## Recommended Sprint Tasks

### HIGH PRIORITY - Data Quality

#### 1. Review & Fix CIF Metadata Gaps üî¥ CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

**Problem:** Many schools have null CIF Section, Division, League, or Subleague values

**Tasks:**
1. Run query to count schools with null metadata
2. Identify which schools need data
3. Determine source for missing data (Athletic.net? CCS website?)
4. Update database with missing values
5. Verify filters work correctly with updated data

**SQL Query to Start:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_schools,
  COUNT(cif_section) as has_section,
  COUNT(cif_division) as has_division,
  COUNT(league) as has_league,
  COUNT(subleague) as has_subleague
FROM schools;
```

**Deliverable:** Database updated with accurate CIF metadata

---

### HIGH PRIORITY - Analytics Features

#### 2. Create Course Performances Page üü° NEW FEATURE
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

**Goal:** Add comprehensive top performances view for each course

**Location:** `/app/courses/[id]/performances/page.tsx`

**Features to Implement:**
- Top 50 or 100 all-time performances on the course
- Separate tabs/sections for Boys and Girls
- Filterable by grade level, school, season year
- Show athlete name, school, time, date, grade
- Link to athlete profile and meet results
- Pagination if showing more than 50 results

**Data Source:** `course_records` table (already optimized)

**UI Reference:** Copy pattern from School Records Performances page

**Query Example:**
```typescript
const { data: performancesData } = await supabase
  .from('course_records')
  .select('*')
  .eq('course_id', courseId)
  .eq('gender', selectedGender)
  .order('rank', { ascending: true })
  .limit(100)
```

**Deliverable:** `/courses/[id]/performances` page showing top times

---

#### 3. Add Team Performance Rankings Page üü° NEW FEATURE
**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes

**Goal:** Show best team performances across all courses

**Location:** `/app/teams/performances/page.tsx` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Best team scores (sum of top 5) on each course
- Separate rankings for Boys and Girls
- Filter by course, season year, CIF division
- Show school name, score, team time, date, meet
- Clickable links to meet results
- Top 25 teams displayed per course

**Data Approach:**
- Query results table grouped by meet_id + school_id
- Filter to races with >= 5 runners from same school
- Calculate team score (sum of top 5 places)
- Rank by lowest score

**Deliverable:** New team performances page with rankings

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Page Enhancements

#### 4. Enhance Course Detail Page with Statistics üü¢ ENHANCEMENT
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

**Current State:** Course detail page shows records and recent meets

**Enhancements to Add:**
1. **Performance Distribution Chart** (optional, if time allows)
   - Histogram showing time distribution
   - Uses Chart.js or Recharts

2. **Course Statistics Card**
   - Total races run on course
   - Total unique athletes
   - Total unique schools
   - Average winning time (boys/girls)
   - Fastest pace per mile

3. **Seasonal Trends** (if time allows)
   - Average times by season year
   - Shows course is getting faster/slower over time

**Data Source:** Aggregate queries on `results` and `races` tables

**Deliverable:** Enhanced course detail page with statistics

---

#### 5. Add Athlete Comparison Tool üü¢ ENHANCEMENT
**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

**Goal:** Allow coaches to compare multiple athletes side-by-side

**Location:** `/app/compare/page.tsx` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Select 2-5 athletes to compare
- Show season-best times for current season
- Show all-time personal best
- Show progression over time (table or chart)
- Compare by course (times on same courses)
- Export comparison to PDF or image

**UI Approach:**
- Dropdown multi-select for athlete selection
- Table with athletes as columns, metrics as rows
- Optional line chart showing progression

**Deliverable:** New athlete comparison page

---

### LOW PRIORITY - Documentation & Cleanup

#### 6. Update CURRENT-STATUS.md üìù DOCUMENTATION
**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

**Problem:** File last updated October 26, now very outdated

**Tasks:**
1. Update system status to reflect current state
2. Add all recent sprint accomplishments
3. Update next priorities section
4. Update infrastructure status (Vercel, not Cloudflare Pages)
5. Remove outdated information

**Deliverable:** Current and accurate CURRENT-STATUS.md file

---

#### 7. Code Refactoring - Extract Grade Calculation üîß TECH DEBT
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

**Problem:** `getGrade()` function duplicated across 3-4 files

**Solution:** Create shared utility

**Tasks:**
1. Create `/lib/utils/grade.ts` file
2. Export `getGrade()` function
3. Export `getGradeLabel()` function
4. Update all pages to import from shared location
5. Test that all pages still work correctly

**Example:**
```typescript
// /lib/utils/grade.ts
export function getGrade(gradYear: number, meetDate: string): number {
  const meetYear = new Date(meetDate).getFullYear()
  const meetMonth = new Date(meetDate).getMonth()
  const seasonYear = meetMonth >= 6 ? meetYear + 1 : meetYear
  return 12 - (gradYear - seasonYear)
}

export function getGradeLabel(grade: number): string {
  const labels: { [key: number]: string } = {
    9: 'Freshman',
    10: 'Sophomore',
    11: 'Junior',
    12: 'Senior'
  }
  return labels[grade] || `Grade ${grade}`
}
```

**Deliverable:** Shared grade utility file, all pages updated

   - Need to check browser console on specific course page

2. **Venue/Distance Extraction** (from earlier sprints)
   - Some meets have venue extraction issues
   - Baylands course has incorrect distance
   - May need manual fixes or scraper improvements

3. **Import Failure** (from earlier sprints - CRITICAL_ISSUES.md)
   - 0/1633 results imported in one test
   - Root cause may be CSV structure vs importer mismatch
   - Should be addressed if planning import sprint

- `/NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md` - This file

**Database Tables to Use:**
- `course_records` - Pre-computed top performances per course
- `school_course_records` - Pre-computed school records per grade/course
- `athlete_best_times` - Season and all-time bests per athlete
- `results` - Raw race results (use for aggregations)

**Patterns to Follow:**
- Set-based state management for filters
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- Checkbox filters with Select All and null support
- Athletic calendar grade calculation: `getGrade(gradYear, meetDate)`

**What's Working Well:**
