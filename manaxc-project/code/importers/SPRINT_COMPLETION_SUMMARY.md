## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Scraper Enhancements
1. **DOM-Based Race Detection**
   - Extracts race IDs from HTML `<a>` tags
   - No longer relies on text pattern matching
   - Captures ALL races, including edge cases

2. **Individual Race Page Scraping**
   - Visits each race page separately
   - Reads gender from race title
   - More reliable than meet overview parsing

3. **Improved Data Extraction**
   - Handles optional initials line in results
   - Proper offset calculation for multi-line DOM elements
   - Increased page load wait time (2s → 4s)

### Import Script Improvements
1. **NULL Handling for Empty IDs**
   - Converts empty strings to NULL
   - Prevents unique constraint violations
   - Allows multiple records without athletic_net_id

2. **Smart Duplicate Detection**
   - Checks athletic_net_id if present
   - Falls back to name combinations
   - Works for both new and existing data

3. **Batch Insert with Fallback**
   - Tries batch insert (100 at a time)
   - Falls back to individual inserts if batch fails
   - Silently skips duplicates without errors

4. **Race-to-Meet Mapping**
   - Built during race import
   - Used for result meet_id population
   - Fixes NULL meet_id constraint violations

### UI Enhancements
1. **Dual-Mode Interface**
   - Toggle between Single Meet and School Season
   - Mode-specific input fields
   - Clear instructions for each mode

2. **Progress Indicators**
   - Stage-by-stage updates (Stage 1/7 through 7/7)
   - Athlete processing counter (every 100)
   - Batch insert progress (every 100 results)

3. **Activity Log**
   - Real-time status messages
   - Color-coded by type (info, success, warning, error)
   - Persistent across operations
