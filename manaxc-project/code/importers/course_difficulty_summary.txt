COURSE DIFFICULTY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
========================================================================================================================

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Montgomery Hill 2.74 Mile

Based on 67 athletes who ran both Montgomery Hill 2.74 and Crystal Springs 2.95:

- **ESTIMATED DIFFICULTY: 1.208** (20.8% harder than flat track)
- **CURRENT IN DATABASE**: "Montgomery Hill | 2.74 Miles" (NOT FOUND - needs difficulty rating)
- **COMPARISON TO CRYSTAL SPRINGS**: Athletes run ~1:16 per mile SLOWER at Montgomery Hill vs Crystal Springs
- **CONCLUSION**: Montgomery Hill is HARDER than Crystal Springs (1.208 vs 1.177)

### 2. Baylands 4K (4,000 Meters = 2.485 miles)

**DATA ISSUE**: Athletes show dramatically faster per-mile paces at Baylands compared to other courses

Example - Takuto Sagara's progression:
- Sep 11: Montgomery Hill 2.74 - 5:45/mile
- Sep 13: Baylands 4K - 5:15/mile  (30 sec/mile FASTER!)
- Sep 25: Montgomery Hill 2.74 - 5:39/mile
- Oct 11: Crystal Springs 2.95 - 5:47/mile

**POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS**:

A) **Baylands is much easier** (flat course, no hills)
   - Estimated difficulty: ~1.10 (10% harder than track)
   - Athletes run 30-40 seconds per mile faster there

B) **Distance measurement error**
   - If course is actually shorter than 4,000m, times would be faster
   - Need to verify actual course distance

C) **Different race effort**
   - Early season race (Sep 13) vs championship races later
   - Freshmen division vs Varsity competition

D) **Altitude/weather factors**
   - Baylands is at sea level, very flat
   - Potentially favorable conditions

**CURRENT IN DATABASE**:
- "Baylands 5K" - difficulty = 3.0 (WRONG - placeholder value)
- "Baylands Park | 5 Kilometers" - difficulty = 1.1298 (seems reasonable for 5K)
- "Baylands Park | 4 Kilometers" - NOT FOUND (needs to be added)

RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================================================================================================

1. **Add Montgomery Hill 2.74 Miles difficulty rating**:
   - Course: "Montgomery Hill | 2.74 Miles"
   - Suggested difficulty: 1.208

2. **Add Baylands 4K course**:
   - Course name: "Baylands Park | 4 Kilometers"
   - Distance: 4000 meters
   - Suggested difficulty: 1.10 (if truly easier) OR need to investigate why times are so fast

3. **Fix incorrect difficulty ratings**:
   - "Crystal Springs 5K" currently = 8.0 (should be ~1.2)
   - "Baylands 5K" currently = 3.0 (should be ~1.1-1.2)
   - "Toro Park 3 Mile" currently = 7.5 (should be ~1.2-1.3)

4. **Verify Baylands 4K distance**:
   - Confirm actual course distance is 4,000m
   - Check if course is certified/measured accurately
