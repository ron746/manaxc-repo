## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run Schema Migration (2 minutes)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open: `/code/database/migration_add_venues_table.sql`
4. Copy entire contents and paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify you see: "✅ Migration complete! Schema is ready for CSV import."

### Step 2: Disable RLS (30 seconds)

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, new query
2. Open: `/code/importers/DISABLE_RLS_FOR_IMPORT.sql`
3. Copy, paste, and run
4. Verify all tables show `rowsecurity = f`

### Step 3: Run Import Scripts (10 minutes)

Open terminal and run in order:

```bash
cd /Users/ron/manaxc/manaxc-project/code/importers

# 1. Venues (5 seconds)
python3 csv_import_01_venues.py

# 2. Courses (10 seconds)
python3 csv_import_02_courses.py

# 3. Athletes (30 seconds)
python3 csv_import_03_athletes.py

# 4. Meets (20 seconds)
python3 csv_import_04_meets.py

# 5. Races (1 minute)
python3 csv_import_05_races.py

# 6. Results (5 minutes)
python3 csv_import_06_results.py
```

Each script will:
- Show preview of data
- Ask for confirmation (type "yes")
- Import data with progress display
- Report summary (inserted/skipped/errors)

### Step 4: Re-enable RLS (30 seconds)

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, new query
2. Open: `/code/importers/ENABLE_RLS_AFTER_IMPORT.sql`
3. Copy, paste, and run
4. Verify read-only policies created

### Step 5: Verify Import (2 minutes)

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Count imported records
SELECT
  'venues' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM venues
UNION ALL
SELECT 'courses', COUNT(*) FROM courses
UNION ALL
SELECT 'athletes', COUNT(*) FROM athletes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'meets', COUNT(*) FROM meets
UNION ALL
SELECT 'races', COUNT(*) FROM races
UNION ALL
SELECT 'results', COUNT(*) FROM results
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected:**
- venues: 54
- courses: 115
- athletes: 1,038
- meets: 208
- races: 445
- results: 6,710

### Step 6: Test Website

Visit: https://manaxc.com

Check that results display correctly!

## What You're Importing

### Historical Westmont XC Data (1966-2024)

**58 years of cross country history!**

- **54 venues** across California
- **115 courses** with difficulty ratings (!)
- **1,038 athletes** spanning 6 decades
- **208 meets** from 2002-2024
- **445 races** (Male/Female/Mixed)
- **6,710 individual results** with times

**Data Quality:**
- ✅ 100% course name matching
- ✅ All difficulty ratings present
- ✅ All foreign keys validated
- ✅ No orphaned records
- ✅ Complete time data (centiseconds)

---

## Key Features of Import Scripts

### Safety
- Preview before importing
- Confirmation required ("yes" to proceed)
- Duplicate detection (skips existing records)
- Timestamped backups of all CSV files
- Can be re-run safely (idempotent)

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time import progress
- Counts: inserted/skipped/errors
- Clear error messages
- Summary reports

### Data Validation
- Foreign key matching
- Missing data warnings
- Composite key lookups (meets, races)
- Athlete matching logic

---

## Schema Changes Made by Migration

**Before:**
```
courses (venue TEXT)
meets (course_id → courses)  ❌ WRONG!
```

**After:**
```
venues (id, name, city, state)
courses (venue_id → venues)
meets (venue_id → venues)     ✅ CORRECT!
races (meet_id → meets, course_id → courses)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Venues can have multiple courses (construction, different distances)
- Meets happen at venues, not specific courses
- Races within a meet use specific courses
- Proper separation of concerns

---

## Import Order (Critical!)

**Must run in this order due to foreign keys:**

1. **venues** ← No dependencies
2. **courses** ← Needs venues
3. **athletes** ← Needs schools (Westmont exists)
4. **meets** ← Needs venues
5. **races** ← Needs meets AND courses
6. **results** ← Needs athletes AND races AND meets

**Running out of order will cause foreign key errors!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Row Level Security" Error
**Fix:** You forgot to run `DISABLE_RLS_FOR_IMPORT.sql`

### "Foreign key violation"
**Fix:** You ran scripts out of order. Start over from step 1.

### "Duplicate key" Error
**Fix:** Data already imported. Script will skip duplicates automatically.

### "No venues found"
**Fix:** Run `csv_import_01_venues.py` first

### "Column venue_id does not exist"
**Fix:** You forgot to run the schema migration SQL

## Post-Import Checklist

After successful import:

- [ ] All 6 tables have expected counts
- [ ] No orphaned foreign keys
- [ ] RLS re-enabled with read-only policies
- [ ] Website displays results correctly
- [ ] Athletes searchable
- [ ] Meets browsable by season
- [ ] Course difficulty ratings showing

---

## Success Metrics

When everything works, you should see:

**Database:**
- 8,668 total records imported
- 0 orphaned foreign keys
- All tables have RLS enabled

**Website:**
- Results page populated
- Athlete profiles load
- Meet details show
- Filters work (season, gender, athlete)
- Times display correctly (MM:SS.CC format)

---

## Next Steps After Import

1. **Verify Data Quality**
   - Spot-check athlete names
   - Review course difficulty ratings
   - Validate sample race results

2. **Performance Check**
   - Test website load times
   - Check query performance
   - Monitor Supabase usage

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Set up Athletic.net scraper
   - Plan for 2025 season updates
   - Implement validation system
   - Add more schools

---

## Technical Details

### Import Performance
- **Total time:** ~10 minutes
- **Batch processing:** Results imported in batches of 100
- **Network:** Uses Supabase REST API
- **Error handling:** Continues on errors, reports at end

### Data Transformations
- Date parsing: MM/DD/YY → YYYY-MM-DD
- Time format: Already in centiseconds (no conversion needed)
- Active status: Calculated from grad_year >= 2025
- Gender: Preserved as M/F format
- Legacy data: All marked as `is_legacy_data = TRUE`

### Foreign Key Matching Logic

**Venues:** Direct name match
**Courses:** Name match, then link to venue_id
**Athletes:** Composite (name + grad_year)
**Meets:** Composite (name + date), link to venue_id
**Races:** Composite (meet_id + name + gender), link to course_id
**Results:** Triple composite (athlete_id + meet_id + race_id)

1. **Check Logs:** Supabase Dashboard → Database → Logs
2. **Review Output:** Python script output shows specific errors
3. **Verify Backups:** All originals backed up with timestamps
4. **Rollback Option:** Migration SQL includes rollback script
