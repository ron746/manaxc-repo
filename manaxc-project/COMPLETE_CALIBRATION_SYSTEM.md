# Complete Course Calibration System - Ready for Testing

**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Session:** Continuation after finding distance-effect bug

## What Was Built

A sophisticated course calibration system based on Malcolm Slaney's research and your coaching expertise:

### 1. **Recommendation Storage System** âœ…
- Saves recommendations (doesn't auto-apply)
- Manual approve/dismiss workflow
- Audit trail (who, when, why)
- Side-by-side network vs AI comparison

### 2. **Course Confidence Rankings** âœ…
- Crystal Springs = 1.0 (primary anchor)
- Other courses rated by:
  - Result count
  - Season-to-season consistency
  - Shared athletes with anchor
- Detects course alterations and anomalies

### 3. **Athlete-Specific Improvement Model** âœ…
- Elite athletes: 1 sec/week
- Slower runners: 2-3 sec/week (greater improvement)
- Girls: Detects plateau/decline patterns
- Uses actual rates when data sufficient

### 4. **Distance Filtering** âœ…
- Only compares similar distances (Â±15%)
- Fixes distance-effect confounding
- Crystal Springs 2.13 excluded from 2.95 comparisons

### 5. **Confidence-Weighted Analysis** âœ…
- Prioritizes high-confidence courses
- Weights by comparison quality
- Direct comparisons > transitive comparisons

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug 1: Distance Effect Confounding
**Problem:** Comparing 2.13 miles to 2.95 miles produced difficulty = 0.907 (impossible)
**Fix:** Only compare courses within Â±15% distance
**File:** `20251030_fix_distance_comparison.sql`

### Bug 2: Fixed Improvement Rate
**Problem:** Used 1.5 sec/week for all athletes
**Fix:** Use athlete-specific rates based on performance level and actual data
**File:** `20251030_athlete_improvement_model.sql`

### Bug 3: Equal Weighting of All Comparisons
**Problem:** Low-quality comparisons weighted same as high-quality
**Fix:** Confidence weighting based on course reliability and comparison quality
**File:** `20251030_confidence_weighted_analysis.sql`

## API Endpoints

### Current (Working)
- **`/api/admin/network-course-calibration-optimized`** - Uses distance filtering
- **`/api/admin/ai-course-analysis`** - Saves recommendations
- **`/api/admin/course-recommendations`** - Manage recommendations

### New (To Switch To)
- **`/api/admin/network-course-calibration-v2`** - Uses athlete-specific rates + confidence weighting

## Testing Sequence

### Step 1: Apply All Migrations (In Order)

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, apply in this exact order:

1. 20251030_create_course_recommendations.sql
2. 20251030_fix_distance_comparison.sql
3. 20251030_add_course_confidence.sql
4. 20251030_confidence_weighted_analysis.sql
5. 20251030_athlete_improvement_model.sql
```

**Expected:**
- 5 migrations succeed
- Crystal Springs confidence = 1.0
- All other courses have confidence 0.0-0.9
- Functions created successfully

### Step 2: Verify Course Confidence Scores

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  distance_meters,
  difficulty_rating,
  confidence_score,
  confidence_notes
FROM courses
ORDER BY confidence_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:**
- Crystal Springs 2.95 at top (1.0000)
- Well-tested courses (0.6-0.9)
- New/untested courses (0.1-0.4)

### Step 3: Test Athlete Improvement Calculation

Pick a known athlete with multiple races:

```sql
SELECT * FROM calculate_athlete_improvement_rate('athlete_id_here');
```

**Expected:**
- Elite athlete: ~-100cs/week (1 sec/week faster)
- Developing athlete: ~-200cs/week (2 sec/week faster)
- Girls with plateau: pattern = 'plateau'
- Girls with decline: pattern = 'declining'

### Step 4: Test Season Anomaly Detection

Pick a course that's been around multiple seasons:

```sql
SELECT * FROM detect_season_anomalies('course_id_here');
```

**Expected:**
- Shows season-by-season performance
- Flags anomalies (z-score > 2.0)
- Suggests possible causes (hot weather, course alteration)

### Step 5: Run Network Calibration (Optimized Version)

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/network-calibration
2. Click "Run Calibration"
3. Wait 5-10 seconds

**Expected:**
- Crystal Springs 2.13 NOT in results (distance filtered)
- All implied difficulties > 1.0
- Confidence scores displayed
- Recommendations saved

### Step 6: Verify Recommendations Saved

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  r.current_difficulty,
  r.recommended_difficulty,
  r.confidence,
  r.shared_athletes_count,
  r.source
FROM course_difficulty_recommendations r
JOIN courses c ON r.course_id = c.id
WHERE r.applied_at IS NULL
ORDER BY ABS(r.recommended_difficulty - r.current_difficulty) DESC;
```

**Expected:**
- 10-20 recommendations saved
- Source = 'network_calibration'
- Confidence varies (0.2-0.9)
- Largest discrepancies first

### Step 7: View on Course Analysis Page

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/course-analysis
2. Look for blue recommendation boxes

**Expected:**
- Courses show network recommendations
- Confidence % displayed
- Shared athletes count shown
- Apply/Dismiss buttons present

### Step 8: Test Apply Workflow

1. Pick high-confidence recommendation (> 70%)
2. Review the recommendation
3. Click "Apply"
4. Confirm

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Course difficulty updated
SELECT name, difficulty_rating FROM courses WHERE id = 'course_id';

-- Recommendation marked applied
SELECT applied_at, applied_by FROM course_difficulty_recommendations WHERE id = 'rec_id';
```

### Step 9: Test AI Analysis

1. Pick Crystal Springs 2.95 (lots of data)
2. Click "AI Analysis"
3. Wait 3-5 seconds

**Expected:**
- Purple recommendation box appears
- Shows confidence and reasoning
- Saved to database
- Can Apply or Dismiss

### Step 10: Compare Network vs AI

Find a course with both recommendations:

**Decision matrix:**
- Both agree + high confidence â†’ Apply immediately
- Both high confidence but disagree â†’ Review reasoning
- Network high, AI low â†’ Trust network (more data)
- Network low, AI high â†’ Investigate (AI might see pattern)
- Both low â†’ Need more data

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Course Confidence Distribution

**Healthy distribution:**
```
1.0:         1 course  (Crystal Springs)
0.8-0.9:     3-5 courses (well-tested)
0.6-0.8:     5-10 courses (good data)
0.4-0.6:     10-15 courses (moderate data)
< 0.4:       All other courses (need more races)
```

### Recommendation Confidence

**What you want to see:**
```
> 0.7:  5-10 recommendations (safe to apply)
0.5-0.7: 5-10 recommendations (review carefully)
< 0.5:  Most recommendations (need more data)
```

### Athlete Improvement Patterns

**Expected distribution:**
```
Linear:       60-70% of athletes (healthy improvement)
Plateau:      15-25% (normal, especially girls mid-season)
Declining:    5-10% (fatigue, injury, late season)
Inconsistent: 5-10% (injury, illness, erratic effort)
```

## Red Flags

### Confidence Issues

ðŸš© **All courses have confidence < 0.3**
- Not enough shared athletes with Crystal Springs
- Need to run more meets

ðŸš© **Crystal Springs confidence < 1.0**
- Manual override didn't apply
- Re-run confidence migration

### Athlete Improvement Issues

ðŸš© **All athletes showing 'declining' pattern**
- Something wrong with calculation
- Check date fields in meets table

ðŸš© **No athletes with 'linear' pattern**
- Not enough races per athlete
- Need more consistent meet schedule

### Calibration Issues

ðŸš© **All implied difficulties < 1.0**
- Distance filtering broke
- Check min/max distance calculation

ðŸš© **All recommendations have confidence = 0**
- Confidence weighting broke
- Check course.confidence_score populated

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Migrations fail with "function already exists"

**Solution:**
```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS function_name CASCADE;
-- Then re-run migration
```

### Issue: Confidence scores all 0.5 (default)

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Re-run confidence calculation for all courses
DO $$
DECLARE course_rec RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR course_rec IN SELECT id FROM courses LOOP
    UPDATE courses
    SET confidence_score = calculate_course_confidence(course_rec.id)
    WHERE id = course_rec.id;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

### Issue: Network calibration returns 0 courses

**Check:**
1. Distance filtering too strict?
2. Not enough shared athletes (min 10)?
3. Anchor course has results?

```sql
-- Check shared athlete counts
WITH anchor AS (
  SELECT id FROM courses WHERE name = 'Crystal Springs, 2.95 Miles'
)
SELECT
  c.name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT r.athlete_id) as total_athletes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT r2.athlete_id) as shared_with_anchor
FROM courses c
JOIN races ra ON ra.course_id = c.id
JOIN results r ON r.race_id = ra.id
LEFT JOIN results r2 ON r2.athlete_id = r.athlete_id
LEFT JOIN races ra2 ON ra2.id = r2.race_id
WHERE ra2.course_id IN (SELECT id FROM anchor)
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY shared_with_anchor DESC;
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… **System is working if:**

1. Crystal Springs confidence = 1.0
2. Distance filtering excludes 2.13 mile course
3. All implied difficulties > 1.0 (physically plausible)
4. Athlete improvement rates vary by level
5. Girls show plateau/decline patterns
6. High-confidence recommendations (> 0.7) look reasonable
7. Low-confidence recommendations (< 0.4) flagged as needing more data
8. Apply workflow updates course difficulty
9. Recommendations tracked in database
10. Season anomaly detection finds known issues
