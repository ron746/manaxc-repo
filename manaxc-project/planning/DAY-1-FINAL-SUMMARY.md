## The Excel File Discovery (GAME CHANGER)

### What's Inside
- **MasterResults** - All race results (9.8 MB)
- **Master Athletes** - Complete athlete roster 1966-2025
- **Master Courses** - All courses Westmont has raced
- **Athletic.net Import** - Raw Athletic.net data (18 MB)
- **Lynbrook Import** - Historical Lynbrook data (21 MB)
- **Export sheets** - Cleaned, ready-to-use data
- **Analytics** - Avg Run, Race Count statistics

### Why This Matters
1. **Skip scraping for historical data** - It's already compiled!
2. **Validate our schema** - See what Ron tracks
3. **Test import wizard** - With real Westmont data
4. **Launch faster** - Import CSV instead of scraping first
5. **58-year legacy** - Amazing marketing story

---

## Updated Day 2 Plan (REVISED)

### Original Plan
1. Make technical decisions (30 min)
2. Deploy database (90 min)
3. Test with sample data (30 min)

### NEW IMPROVED Plan
1. Make technical decisions (30 min) ← Same
2. Deploy database (90 min) ← Same
3. **Export Excel to CSV (30 min)** ← NEW
4. **Test import with real data (30 min)** ← NEW
5. **Full import if successful (30 min)** ← BONUS

**Result:** End of Day 2, we'll have database + REAL historical data!

## Key Decisions Ready for Tomorrow

### Decision 1: Time Storage
**Options:**
- A) CENTISECONDS (OLD project: 19:30.50 = 117050)
- B) SECONDS (NEW project: 19:30 = 1170)

**Recommendation:** Check Ron's Excel format, match it

### Decision 2: Database Schema
**Approach:** Use OLD project v2.4 as base, simplify

**Keep:**
- Materialized views (performance)
- RLS policies (security)
- Indexes (speed)

**Simplify:**
- Remove over-engineered fields
- Match Excel column structure

### Decision 3: Data Source Priority
**NEW PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. Import Excel data first (Days 2-4)
2. Build scraper second (Days 5-6)
3. Use scraper for ongoing updates only

---

## Assets Ready to Reuse

### From OLD Project
- ✅ Puppeteer scraper (`athletic-net-scraper-v2.js`)
- ✅ Database schema v2.4 (proven)
- ✅ Import wizard UI (5-step process)
- ✅ RLS policies
- ✅ Materialized views
- ✅ Name parsing patterns

### From Ron's Excel File
- ✅ 58 years of Westmont data
- ✅ Name parsing logic (First/Last/Last2)
- ✅ Course database (Master Courses)
- ✅ Time format standards
- ✅ Clean export-ready data

---

## Risk Mitigation Complete

### Risks Identified ✅
1. ✅ Context loss → SOLVED (00-START-HERE.md)
2. ✅ Data quality → SOLVED (validation plan + lessons learned)
3. ✅ Reinventing wheel → SOLVED (reuse assets identified)
4. ✅ Historical data → SOLVED (Excel file!)
5. ⏳ Technical decisions → READY (Day 2 morning)
