# Path Decision: Two Valid Approaches

**Created:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** Ron needs to choose which path to take

---

## The Two Paths You Have

### Path A: "The Learning Builder Path"
**What we've been planning (Days 1-60)**
- Build a full web/mobile app with Next.js, React Native, Supabase
- Learn modern development, AI-assisted coding
- Create comprehensive platform with all features
- Timeline: 60 days to MVP
- Time: ~20 hours/week
- First revenue: Month 3+

**Pros:**
- You learn valuable tech skills
- You enjoy the building process
- You create a professional platform
- Reusable code from previous attempts
- Can scale to thousands of users

**Cons:**
- 60 days before validation
- High time commitment (20 hrs/week)
- Risk building something nobody wants
- Harder to pivot if wrong

### Path B: "The Stupidly Simple Path"
**What this new plan proposes (Weeks 1-12)**
- Google Sheets + Google Forms for calculator
- Carrd.co landing page (no code)
- Validate with real coaches FIRST
- Timeline: 12 weeks to $1K/month
- Time: ~5 hours/week
- First revenue: Week 12

**Pros:**
- Validate idea in Week 1 (survey)
- First customer by Week 12
- 5 hrs/week (actually doable with 2 jobs)
- Fail fast if it won't work
- Can upgrade to Path A later if successful

**Cons:**
- Less fun (no coding/learning)
- Google Sheets is janky
- Limited features initially
- Less impressive technically

## My Honest Assessment

**The "Stupidly Simple" plan is more likely to succeed as a business.**

Here's why:
1. You have 2 full-time jobs (banker + coach)
2. Finding 20 hrs/week for 60 days is HARD
3. Finding 5 hrs/week for 12 weeks is DOABLE
4. You validate in Week 1, not Week 60
5. If nobody pays, you save 55 days of effort

**BUT** - I understand you want to learn and enjoy building.

## The Hybrid Path (My Recommendation)

### Phase 0: Validation First (Weeks 1-2) - 10 hours
**Use the "Stupidly Simple" approach:**
- [ ] Week 1: Send survey to 5 coaches
- [ ] Week 1: Create landing page on Carrd.co
- [ ] Week 2: Build Google Sheets calculator (10 courses)
- [ ] Week 2: Test with Westmont team

**Decision Point:**
- If 3+ coaches say they'd pay → Proceed to Phase 1
- If not → Pivot or kill

### Phase 1: Learn While Building (Weeks 3-12) - 40 hours
**Hybrid approach:**
- [ ] Keep Google Sheets version LIVE (serving customers)
- [ ] Build Next.js version in parallel (for learning)
- [ ] Use Excel data you already have
- [ ] Focus on course rating algorithm (the interesting part)
- [ ] 5 hours/week: 2 hrs maintaining Sheets, 3 hrs learning to code

**This way:**
- You're making money from Week 12 (Sheets version)
- You're learning to code (Next.js version)
- You have real users giving feedback
- You can migrate users when ready

### Phase 2: Transition (Weeks 13-20) - 30 hours
**Once you have paying customers:**
- [ ] Finish Next.js version
- [ ] Migrate paying customers
- [ ] Add features based on real feedback
- [ ] Scale up

## Questions for You

### 1. **Why do you want to build this?**
- A) Primarily to learn coding/AI (then Path A is fine)
- B) Primarily to make money (then Path B is smarter)
- C) Both equally (then Hybrid path)

### 2. **How much time can you REALLY commit?**
- A) 5 hours/week consistently (Stupidly Simple path)
- B) 10-15 hours/week consistently (Hybrid path)
- C) 20+ hours/week (Full build path)

### 3. **What would make you happiest in 6 months?**
- A) "I built a real app and learned so much" (even if $0 revenue)
- B) "I'm making $1K/month and can quit my bank job eventually"
- C) "I built a real app AND it's making $1K/month"

### 4. **Risk tolerance:**
- A) "I want to validate FAST - if it won't work, kill it by Week 12"
- B) "I'm OK investing 60 days before knowing if anyone will pay"
- C) "I don't care about revenue, this is for learning"

## What I Recommend Based on What You've Said

You mentioned:
> "I do want to try and build an app as I find it enjoyable to learn AI and how to build an app"

This tells me:
1. **Learning is important to you** ✅
2. **Enjoyment matters** ✅
3. **But** you also wrote that plan about $1K/month...

**So I think you want BOTH.**

## The Ron-Optimized Plan

### Weeks 1-4: Validate & Learn Foundation
**Goal:** Prove someone will pay + set up to learn

**Week 1 (5 hours):**
- [ ] Monday: Send survey to 5 coaches (1 hour)
- [ ] Saturday morning: Set up Supabase database (2 hours) - **THIS IS LEARNING**
- [ ] Saturday afternoon: Create Google Sheets calculator (2 hours) - **THIS IS INCOME**

**Week 2 (5 hours):**
- [ ] Review survey responses
- [ ] If 3+ positive → continue
- [ ] Set up Next.js project (learning)
- [ ] Test Sheets calculator with Westmont (income)

**Week 3-4 (10 hours total):**
- [ ] Build course rating algorithm in Next.js (learning + core feature)
- [ ] Keep improving Sheets version (income)
- [ ] Start importing Excel data to Supabase (learning)

**Validation checkpoint:** If coaches aren't interested by Week 4, pivot or kill.

### Weeks 5-12: Build While Earning
**Goal:** Have paying customers + working Next.js app

**Week 5-8 (20 hours):**
- [ ] Launch Sheets version to 3 schools ($90 revenue)
- [ ] Build Next.js course calculator UI (learning)
- [ ] Connect to Supabase with real data (learning)

**Week 9-12 (20 hours):**
- [ ] Migrate 3 paying schools to Next.js version
- [ ] Add one feature based on feedback
- [ ] Get to $300-500/month
- [ ] You've learned Next.js, Supabase, React

**By Week 12:**
- ✅ You have paying customers ($300-500/month)
- ✅ You built a real Next.js app
- ✅ You learned modern development
- ✅ You validated the business
- ✅ You only spent 5 hrs/week

### Weeks 13+: Scale What Works
Now you can choose:
- Keep building features (if you love it)
- Focus on sales (if you want money)
- Hire someone to code (if you want time back)
