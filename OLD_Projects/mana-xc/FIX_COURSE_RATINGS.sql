-- Fix Course Ratings - Correct Interpretation
-- Lower rating = HARDER course (you run slower time there)
-- Higher rating = EASIER course (you run faster time there)

-- User's expected equivalencies (all equal performance):
-- - Crystal Springs 2.95mi: 16:00.0 (baseline = 1.000)
-- - Montgomery Hill 2.74mi: 15:13.0 â†’ rating = 0.951 (HARDER - shorter distance but slower per-mile pace)
-- - Golden Gate Park 2.93mi: 15:29.7 â†’ rating = 0.968 (HARDER - slightly shorter but slower per-mile pace)
-- - Woodward Park 5000m: 16:19.6 â†’ rating = 1.020 (EASIER - longer but similar per-mile pace)
