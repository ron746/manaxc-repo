## QUICK ADMIN QUERIES

### Check Admin Role
```sql
SELECT user_id, role, email
FROM user_profiles
WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### View Recent Admin Actions
```sql
SELECT 
  al.created_at,
  al.action,
  al.details,
  u.email
FROM admin_log al
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = al.admin_user_id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Count Potential Issues
```sql
-- Duplicate results
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT athlete_id, race_id
  FROM results
  GROUP BY athlete_id, race_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) as dupes;

-- Similar athletes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT a1.id, a2.id
  FROM athletes a1
  JOIN athletes a2 ON 
    LOWER(a1.first_name) = LOWER(a2.first_name)
    AND LOWER(a1.last_name) = LOWER(a2.last_name)
    AND a1.id < a2.id
  WHERE ABS(a1.graduation_year - a2.graduation_year) <= 1
) as similar;
```
