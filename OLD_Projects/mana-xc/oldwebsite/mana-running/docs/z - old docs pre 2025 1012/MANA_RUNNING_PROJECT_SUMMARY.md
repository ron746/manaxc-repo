# MANA RUNNING - PROJECT SUMMARY & DEVELOPER GUIDE

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Mana Running** is a production cross country statistics platform designed to become the definitive XC tool - like xcstats.com but with superior analytics and user experience.

**Live URL:** https://mana-running.vercel.app/

**GitHub Repository:** ron681/mana-running (main branch)

### Target Users
1. **Coaches:** Team analysis, varsity selection, performance tracking, championship planning
2. **Athletes:** Personal progress tracking, course PRs, season goals
3. **Fans:** Meet results, school comparisons, historical data

### Scalability Requirements
**Database Design Philosophy:** Build for 1,000,000+ records from day one
- **Never fetch-and-filter** - Use database aggregation and SQL functions
- **No arbitrary limits** - Queries must work regardless of dataset size
- **Server-side processing** - Heavy computations happen in PostgreSQL, not JavaScript
- **Indexed queries** - All common queries must use proper database indexes
- **Current scale:** 4,477 athletes, ~10,000+ results
- **Target scale:** 100,000+ athletes, 1,000,000+ results

**Example:** Finding school records should use a SQL function that returns 5-10 rows, not fetching 50,000+ results and processing in JavaScript.

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript, React Server Components
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time features
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment:** Vercel with automatic GitHub integration
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (‚ö†Ô∏è needs migration from deprecated helpers)

### Database Structure (Key Tables)
- `athletes` - Athlete records with unique constraint
- `schools` - High school/team data
- `courses` - Cross country courses with ratings and difficulty
- `meets` - Meet/competition information
- `races` - Individual race events within meets (FK to meets, courses)
- `results` - Performance results (FK to athletes, races, meets)
- `school_transfers` - Athlete school transfer history (FK to athletes)

### Critical Relationships
```
courses (id) <--FK-- races (course_id)
meets (id) <--FK-- races (meet_id)
races (id) <--FK-- results (race_id)
athletes (id) <--FK-- results (athlete_id)
```

### Critical Constraints
```sql
-- Prevents duplicate athletes
ALTER TABLE athletes 
ADD CONSTRAINT athletes_unique_person 
UNIQUE (first_name, last_name, current_school_id, graduation_year);
```

### Database Query Best Practices (CRITICAL)

**Rule 1: Use SQL Functions for Aggregations**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Database does the work
SELECT * FROM get_school_xc_record('school-id', 'M', NULL);
-- Returns 1 row with the fastest XC time

-- ‚ùå WRONG: Fetching all data to JavaScript
SELECT * FROM results WHERE school_id = '...' LIMIT 10000;
-- Returns 10,000 rows, then filters in JavaScript
```

**Rule 2: Never Use Hard Limits**
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Will break at scale
.limit(1000)  // Breaks when >1000 results exist

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use SQL aggregation
.rpc('get_top_performances', { school_id: '...', limit: 10 })
// Only returns the top 10, regardless of total rows
```

**Rule 3: Index All Common Query Patterns**
Every query in production should use an index. See `/docs/IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md` for required indexes.

**Rule 4: Pagination for Lists**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Paginate large lists
.range(startIndex, endIndex)

// ‚ùå WRONG: Fetch everything
.select('*')  // No limit at all
```

**Rule 5: Profile Before Deploying**
Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in Supabase SQL Editor to verify query performance before deploying to production.

## üö® DEVELOPER COMMUNICATION STYLE (CRITICAL)

### User Expectations - NO EXCEPTIONS
- ‚ùå **NO praise or flattery** ("That's a great question", "Excellent idea")
- ‚úÖ **Direct, actionable solutions immediately**
- ‚úÖ **Step-by-step detailed instructions with exact file paths**
- ‚úÖ **Technical accuracy over diplomatic language**
- ‚úÖ **Performance-first mindset**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive solutions, not partial examples**
- ‚úÖ **Skip pleasantries, get straight to implementation**
- ‚úÖ **Beginner-friendly instructions - user has less experience**

### Response Format
1. State the solution immediately
2. Provide exact file paths
3. Include complete code (no placeholders)
4. Add verification steps
5. No unnecessary explanations

---

## üìä DATA INTEGRITY - DUPLICATE ATHLETE CLEANUP

### Issue Resolved (October 2025)
**Problem:** Massive athlete duplication in database
- Aaron Soni: 32 duplicate records
- Adrian Ketterer: 23 duplicate records
- Total: 5,805 athletes (1,328 were duplicates)

### Solution Implemented
**Result:** 5,805 ‚Üí 4,477 unique athletes

**SQL Script:** `/merge_athlete_duplicates.sql`

**What Was Done:**
1. Identified duplicates by `(first_name, last_name, current_school_id, graduation_year)`
2. Kept oldest record (by `created_at`) for each unique athlete
3. Updated all `results` table foreign keys to point to kept athlete
4. Updated all `school_transfers` table foreign keys to point to kept athlete
5. Deleted 1,328 duplicate athlete records
6. Added unique constraint to prevent future duplicates

**Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check no duplicates remain (should return 0 rows)
SELECT first_name, last_name, current_school_id, graduation_year, COUNT(*) as count
FROM athletes
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, current_school_id, graduation_year
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Verify results integrity (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results r
LEFT JOIN athletes a ON a.id = r.athlete_id
WHERE a.id IS NULL;

-- Verify transfers integrity (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM school_transfers st
LEFT JOIN athletes a ON a.id = st.athlete_id
WHERE a.id IS NULL;
```

### Preventing Future Duplicates

**Application-Level Check (Required Before Athlete Creation):**
```typescript
// Check before inserting new athlete
const { data: existing } = await supabase
  .from('athletes')
  .select('id')
  .eq('first_name', firstName)
  .eq('last_name', lastName)
  .eq('current_school_id', schoolId)
  .eq('graduation_year', gradYear)
  .single();

if (existing) {
  // Use existing athlete ID instead of creating new
  return existing.id;
}

// Only create if doesn't exist
const { data: newAthlete } = await supabase
  .from('athletes')
  .insert({
    first_name: firstName,
    last_name: lastName,
    current_school_id: schoolId,
    graduation_year: gradYear
  })
  .select()
  .single();

return newAthlete.id;
```

**Add this check to:**
- Meet result import functions
- Manual athlete creation forms
- CSV upload processors
- API endpoints that create athletes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & PENDING FIXES

### 1. Race Total Participants Count (CRITICAL)
**Status:** Identified October 2025  
**Issue:** The `total_participants` field on `races` table contains incorrect/stale values. This field should match the actual count of results for each race but is not automatically maintained.

**Impact:**
- Race statistics show wrong participant counts
- Course performance metrics may be inaccurate
- Team scoring calculations could be affected

**Root Cause:**
- No trigger to auto-update `total_participants` when results are inserted/updated/deleted
- Manual imports may not update this field
- Historical data has accumulated inconsistencies

**Solution:** See IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md #1 for complete fix (trigger creation + data update)

**Quick Verification:**
```sql
-- Find races with count mismatches
SELECT 
  r.id, r.name,
  r.total_participants as stored,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results WHERE race_id = r.id) as actual
FROM races r
WHERE r.total_participants != (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results WHERE race_id = r.id)
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Course-Race Relationship
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Note:** The `races` table has `course_id` (FK to `courses.id`). This relationship is critical for:
- Course performance tracking
- Course difficulty ratings
- Course-specific PRs
- Historical course comparisons

**Schema:**
- `courses.id` ‚Üí Primary key
- `races.course_id` ‚Üí Foreign key to courses
- One course can have many races
- Each race is associated with one course (nullable)

## üîß CRITICAL MAINTENANCE TASKS

### 1. Supabase Auth Migration (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Not started
**Issue:** Using deprecated Supabase auth helpers
**Action Required:**
- Migrate to `@supabase/ssr` package
- Update all auth middleware
- Test authentication flows

**Migration Guide:**
```bash
# Install new package
npm install @supabase/ssr

# Remove deprecated package
npm uninstall @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
```

Update auth client creation:
```typescript
// OLD (deprecated)
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'

// NEW
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export const supabase = createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)
```

### 2. Database Indexing (PERFORMANCE)
**Recommended Indexes:**
```sql
-- Speed up athlete lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_athletes_school_grad 
ON athletes(current_school_id, graduation_year);

-- Speed up results queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_results_athlete 
ON results(athlete_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_results_race 
ON results(race_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_results_meet 
ON results(meet_id);

-- Speed up meet searches
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_meets_date 
ON meets(meet_date DESC);

-- Speed up race queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_races_meet 
ON races(meet_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_races_course 
ON races(course_id);
```

### 3. Data Validation Rules
**Implement these checks:**
- Graduation year must be 2024-2030 (current valid range)
- Race times must be positive and realistic (5:00 - 40:00 for 5K)
- Meet dates cannot be in future (except scheduled meets)
- School IDs must reference existing schools

## üîç COMMON QUERIES

### Find Athletes by School
```sql
SELECT a.*, s.name as school_name
FROM athletes a
JOIN schools s ON s.id = a.current_school_id
WHERE s.name ILIKE '%Westmont%'
ORDER BY a.last_name, a.first_name;
```

### Get Athlete's Race Results
```sql
SELECT 
  r.finish_time,
  r.place,
  m.name as meet_name,
  m.date,
  ra.distance,
  ra.gender
FROM results r
JOIN races ra ON ra.id = r.race_id
JOIN meets m ON m.id = r.meet_id
WHERE r.athlete_id = '<athlete-id>'
ORDER BY m.date DESC;
```

### Team Performance Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  a.first_name,
  a.last_name,
  AVG(r.finish_time) as avg_time,
  COUNT(r.id) as race_count,
  MIN(r.finish_time) as pr
FROM results r
JOIN athletes a ON a.id = r.athlete_id
JOIN races ra ON ra.id = r.race_id
WHERE a.current_school_id = '<school-id>'
  AND ra.distance = '5K'
  AND ra.gender = 'M'
GROUP BY a.id, a.first_name, a.last_name
ORDER BY avg_time ASC
LIMIT 7;  -- Top 7 for varsity
```

### Find Course PRs
```sql
SELECT 
  a.first_name,
  a.last_name,
  MIN(r.finish_time) as pr,
  m.course_name
FROM results r
JOIN athletes a ON a.id = r.athlete_id
JOIN meets m ON m.id = r.meet_id
WHERE m.course_name = 'Crystal Springs'
GROUP BY a.id, a.first_name, a.last_name, m.course_name
ORDER BY pr ASC;
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Duplicate Athletes Appearing Again
**Check:**
1. Is unique constraint active?
   ```sql
   SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints
   WHERE table_name = 'athletes' AND constraint_name = 'athletes_unique_person';
   ```
2. Are you running duplicate checks before INSERT?
3. Check import scripts for duplicate creation logic

### Performance Issues
**Quick Fixes:**
1. Check if indexes exist (see Database Indexing section)
2. Review slow queries in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Query Performance
3. Consider pagination for large result sets
4. Use React Server Components for data fetching

### Authentication Errors
**Common Issues:**
1. Deprecated auth helpers (see Migration section)
2. Missing environment variables
3. Incorrect redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard
