## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITIES (Do Now)

### 1. Race Participant Counts Fix
**Status:** Not started  
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

- Update existing data with correct counts
- Create trigger for auto-maintenance
- Add application-level validation

See IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md #1 for detailed steps.

---

### 2. Duplicate Prevention in Code
**Status:** Not started  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

Add duplicate check before ALL athlete creation:
- Meet import functions
- Admin athlete creation forms
- CSV upload processors
- API endpoints

---

### 3. Database Indexes
**Status:** Not started  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** HIGH

Add indexes for massive performance boost:
- Athletes (school_id, graduation_year)
- Results (athlete_id, race_id, meet_id)
- Meets (meet_date)
- Races (meet_id, course_id)

---

## üü° CURRENT ISSUES / IN PROGRESS

### Team Records Page
**Status:** In progress (blocked)  
**Issue:** SQL function has column naming conflicts

**Needs:**
1. Debug `get_school_top_team_performances` function
2. Add `res_` prefix to all result columns
3. Create page at `/schools/[id]/team-records`
4. Test with actual team data

**Features When Complete:**
- Top 10 team performances (5-person times)
- By course and overall
- Team scoring analysis

---

### Course Page - Top 5 Team Performances
**Status:** In progress (blocked)  
**Code:** Implemented but not displaying data

**Known Problems:**
- May not be finding teams with 5+ runners at same race
- Gender filtering might not match data correctly
- Need diagnostic logging to identify root cause

**Location:** `/app/courses/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 702-815)

## üìã NOTES

### Team Performance Feature Status
Despite multiple attempts:
- Grouping logic implemented (race-based) ‚úì
- Gender filtering in place ‚úì
- UI components properly structured ‚úì
- Build succeeds with no errors ‚úì

**Likely causes:**
- Data availability: May not have races with 5+ runners from same school
- Data structure mismatch: Gender field format or race relationships
- Silent failure: No error logging to diagnose issue

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive logging, then revisit after confirming test data exists.

---

### Development Notes

- **Environment:** MacBook Air M2, macOS
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploy to Vercel on push to `main`
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL 15.1
