```bash
cd mana-running

# Copy documentation files
cp PROJECT_CONTEXT.md ./docs/
cp MANA_RUNNING_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md ./docs/
cp IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md ./docs/
cp QUICK_REFERENCE.md ./docs/

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update documentation to v2.0 (consolidated and cleaned)"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Delete Old Files
Remove these from your Google Drive:

- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_STARTER_GUIDE.md
- RACE_PARTICIPANTS_FIX.md
- NEW_CONVERSATION_STARTER.txt
- PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS_UPDATED.txt
- team_performance_diagnostic.sql
- team_performance_with_debugging.tsx
- DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (old version)

### 5. Test New Documentation
Start a new Claude conversation and use this prompt:
```
Search my Google Drive for "Mana Running Documentation" 
and review PROJECT_CONTEXT.md. Tell me what the critical 
technical detail is about time storage.
```

Expected response: Should mention times are stored in CENTISECONDS.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

### For Every Developer
**ALWAYS REMEMBER:** Times are stored in **CENTISECONDS**, not seconds!
- Database field: `time_seconds` (misleading name)
- 15:30.00 = 93000 centiseconds
- Always divide by 100 for display: `time_seconds / 100`

### For New Claude Conversations
**ALWAYS START WITH:**
```
Search my Google Drive for "Mana Running Documentation" 
and review PROJECT_CONTEXT.md before answering.
```

### For Database Work
**CHECK THESE FIRST:**
1. DATABASE_SCALABILITY.md - Query patterns
2. IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md - Pending database work
3. schema-changelog.md - Recent changes

---

## üìä BEFORE vs AFTER

### Before (17 Files, ~150KB)
- Redundant information across multiple files
- Outdated task lists
- Debugging files no longer needed
- No clear starting point
- Time storage issue not emphasized

### After (9 Files, ~80KB)
- Clear, focused documentation
- Current priorities only
- No obsolete debugging files
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md as clear entry point
- Time storage CRITICAL section at top

**Result:** 47% smaller, 100% more useful

---
