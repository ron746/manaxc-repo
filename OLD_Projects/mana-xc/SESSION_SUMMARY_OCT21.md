# Session Summary - October 21, 2025

## üéØ Session Goals Achieved
- Primary Objective: Create clean, accessible landing page and fix Tailwind CSS configuration
- Status: Complete

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments
1. **Fixed Global CSS Dark Theme Issue** - Changed `globals.css` from dark (#0d1117) to white background
2. **Created Tailwind Configuration** - Added missing `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
3. **Built Clean Landing Page** - Minimal, professional design matching old site aesthetic
4. **Fixed Header/Footer Components** - Simplified to colorblind-friendly white theme
5. **Added Missing Environment Variable** - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for API routes
6. **Created Accessibility Guidelines** - Comprehensive `ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES.md` for all future pages
7. **Fixed School Roster Page** - Changed from dark maroon headers to light gray for better readability

## üîç Critical Discoveries
- **Tailwind CSS wasn't loading** - Missing config files caused all styles to fail
- **Browser caching in Safari** - Required hard refresh to see style changes
- **Dark theme was global** - Body background in `globals.css` was forcing black on entire site
- **Colorblind accessibility is critical** - User has colorblindness, requires high-contrast light themes only

## üé® Design System Established
Created comprehensive accessibility guidelines:
- **Colors**: Gray-900/800 text on white/gray-50 backgrounds only
- **Highlights**: Yellow-50 background with yellow-500 borders
- **No dark backgrounds**: Everything must be light theme
- **High contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratios
- **Thick borders**: 2px minimum for visual separation

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/page.tsx` - Clean landing page (replaced marketing version)
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind
- `components/layout/PageLayout.tsx` - Reusable layout wrapper
- `ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES.md` - Complete colorblind-friendly design system
- `SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT21.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `app/globals.css` - Changed from dark theme to white background
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed forced Header/Footer (now opt-in via PageLayout)
- `components/layout/Header.tsx` - Simplified to white theme with minimal nav
- `components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Changed to light gray theme
- `app/schools/[id]/roster/page.tsx` - Changed table headers from maroon to light gray
- `.env.local` - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- `next.config.js` - Removed redirect from / to /top-performances

### Key Technical Fixes:
1. **Tailwind not working**: Created missing `tailwind.config.js` with proper content paths
2. **Dark backgrounds**: Fixed `globals.css` body background from `#0d1117` to `#ffffff`
3. **Missing env var**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to fix Top Performances API calls
4. **Browser cache**: Documented need for hard refresh in Safari (`Cmd + Shift + R`)

## üöÄ Next Session Readiness

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. [ ] Build athlete profile page (10 hours)
   - Individual athlete stats
   - Season-by-season progression
   - Complete race history
   - PR timelines

2. [ ] Build most improved page (6 hours)
   - Season-over-season improvement rankings
   - Filter by grade
   - Percentage improvement calculations

3. [ ] Review all existing pages for accessibility (4 hours)

### Expected Results:
- Athlete profiles accessible from school rosters and top performances
- Most improved rankings showcase breakout performances
- All pages follow accessibility guidelines

## üéì Key Learnings
1. **Always check for config files first** - Missing Tailwind config caused hours of debugging
2. **Global CSS can override everything** - Body styles in `globals.css` affect entire app
3. **Safari caching is aggressive** - Need hard refresh or incognito for style changes
4. **Colorblind users need high contrast** - No dark themes, thick borders, yellow highlights only
5. **Landing pages should be minimal** - User prefers simple, centered design like old site
