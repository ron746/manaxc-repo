# Session Summary - October 20, 2025

## Session Overview
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Focus:** Optimize batch import performance from 9+ minutes to 5.4 seconds (~100x faster)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - All systems operational

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Performance Optimization (Primary Achievement)

**Problem Identified:**
- Old `batch-import` route took 9+ minutes to import 2,776 results
- Killed after timeout with partial data
- Root cause: Nested loops with individual inserts (~15,000+ database queries)

**Solution Designed:**
- 7 normalized CSV file architecture
- Bulk insert strategy with batching (500 records at a time)
- Athlete deduplication using `(full_name, school_id, graduation_year)`

**Results:**
- ‚ö° **5.4 seconds** to import 2,776 results
- **~100x performance improvement**
- Successfully imported 2025 season:
  - 3 venues
  - 3 courses
  - 82 schools
  - 4 meets
  - 18 races
  - 1,995 athletes
  - 2,774 results (filtered 2 DNF/DNS)

## Technical Work Completed

### 1. Scraper Updates

**Created: `scripts/athletic-net-scraper-v3.js`**
- Generates 7 normalized CSV files automatically
- Calculates graduation year from grade: `seasonYear + (13 - grade)`
- Extracts distance in meters from race names
- Parses venue location properly (city, state)
- Output files:
  - `{prefix}-venues.csv`
  - `{prefix}-courses.csv`
  - `{prefix}-schools.csv`
  - `{prefix}-meets.csv`
  - `{prefix}-races.csv`
  - `{prefix}-athletes.csv`
  - `{prefix}-results.csv`

**Created: `scripts/convert-to-normalized-csvs.js`**
- Converts existing JSON files to 7 CSV format
- Useful for reprocessing old scrapes
- Usage: `node convert-to-normalized-csvs.js <jsonFile> <season>`
- Example: `node convert-to-normalized-csvs.js athletic-net-1076-2025.json 2025`

### 2. Database Schema Updates

**Updated Athletes Table:**
- ‚ùå Removed: `first_name` column
- ‚ùå Removed: `last_name` column
- ‚ùå Removed: `ath_net_id` column
- ‚úÖ Required: `full_name` (NOT NULL)
- ‚úÖ Added: `graduation_year` (calculated from grade)
- ‚úÖ New unique constraint: `(full_name, current_school_id, graduation_year)`
- ‚úÖ Index added: `idx_athletes_full_name`

**Rationale:**
- Simpler name handling (no parsing edge cases)
- Graduation year essential for athlete uniqueness
- Same name at same school but different grad years = different athletes

### 3. Optimized Import API

**Created: `app/api/admin/batch-import-v2/route.ts`**

**Import Process (7 Steps):**
1. **Venues** - Insert by name, city, state
2. **Courses** - Insert by venue_id + distance_meters
3. **Schools** - Insert by name
4. **Meets** - Insert by athletic_net_id
5. **Races** - Insert by meet_id + name, linked to courses
6. **Athletes** - Insert by full_name + school + grad_year
7. **Results** - Bulk insert in batches of 500 (filters out DNF/DNS)

**Key Features:**
- Uses Maps for ID lookups (O(1) complexity)
- Batches results (500 at a time) to avoid payload limits
- Filters invalid times (DNF, DNS, null values)
- Returns detailed count summary

**Performance:**
- Total queries: ~100 (vs 15,000+ before)
- Time: 5.4 seconds (vs 9+ minutes before)
- Handles 2,776 results effortlessly

### 4. SQL Scripts Created

**`CLEAN_ALL_TABLES.sql`**
- Quick cleanup for fresh imports
- Deletes all data from all tables
- Verifies counts = 0

**`CLEAN_AND_UPDATE_SCHEMA.sql`**
- Complete schema update for athletes table
- Removes first/last name columns
- Adds unique constraint on (full_name, school, grad_year)
- Includes verification queries

**`CHECK_COUNTS.sql`**
- Quick verification of table row counts
- Useful for confirming imports succeeded

## Key Insights & Design Decisions

### 1. Athlete Uniqueness
**Decision:** Use `(full_name, school_id, graduation_year)` as unique key

**Rationale:**
- Same name at same school but different grad years = different people
- Example: "John Smith" Class of 2025 ‚â† "John Smith" Class of 2027
- Graduation year calculated: `seasonYear + (13 - grade)`
- Grade 9 in 2025 ‚Üí graduates 2029

### 2. Name Parsing Abandoned
**Decision:** Store only `full_name`, remove first/last split

**Rationale:**
- Athletic.net data is in "FirstName LastName" format
- Multi-word names are ambiguous ("Edgar Gomez Tapia")
- Suffixes add complexity (Jr., Sr., III)
- Simpler to store full name and avoid parsing edge cases

### 3. Bulk Insert Strategy
**Decision:** 7 separate CSV files with dependency order

**Rationale:**
- Venues ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Schools ‚Üí Meets ‚Üí Races ‚Üí Athletes ‚Üí Results
- Each entity type inserted once with all duplicates removed
- Map lookups for foreign key resolution (O(1))
- Batch inserts (500 at a time) for large datasets

### 4. DNF/DNS Filtering
**Decision:** Filter out results without valid times

**Rationale:**
- Results table has `time_cs NOT NULL` constraint
- DNF (Did Not Finish) and DNS (Did Not Start) have no time
- 2 records filtered out from 2,776 total (99.9% success rate)

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Environment
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL 15.1
- Server: Next.js 14 dev server (localhost:3000)
- Data: Westmont HS 2025 season (4 meets, 2,776 results)

### Verification Steps
1. ‚úÖ Table counts match expected values
2. ‚úÖ Graduation years populated correctly
3. ‚úÖ No duplicate athletes in database
4. ‚úÖ All races linked to courses
5. ‚úÖ All results have valid times

### Known Issues
- None! All tests passed.

## Next Session Recommendations

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Import remaining seasons** (2022, 2023, 2024)
   - Run conversion script on existing JSON files
   - Import via batch-import-v2 API
   - Each season should take ~5 seconds

2. **Calculate derived fields**
   - Update `total_participants` for races
   - Calculate athlete PRs
   - Refresh materialized views

3. **Test with 4-year data**
   - Verify athlete progression (grade 9 ‚Üí 12)
   - Check graduation year consistency
   - Validate course ratings across seasons

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add upsert logic for re-imports**
   - Currently uses INSERT (clean database)
   - Need ON CONFLICT handling for updates
   - Add unique constraints where missing

2. **Integrate with Scrape Request Manager**
   - Auto-generate 7 CSVs after scraping
   - One-click import from UI
   - Progress tracking and error handling

3. **Add data validation**
   - Warn if graduation years seem wrong
   - Flag suspicious times (too fast/slow)
   - Identify potential duplicate athletes
