## Session Summary - October 20, 2025

### âœ… What Was Accomplished

**1. Complete 4-Year Data Import**
- Imported all Westmont XC data from 2022-2025 seasons
- 31,721 total race results across 4 years
- 13,487 athletes, 674 schools, 558 races, 17 courses
- Import performance: 40 seconds total (100x faster than original approach!)

**2. Per-Course PR System Created**
- `athlete_course_prs` materialized view operational in Supabase
- Tracks each athlete's best time at each specific course (RAW times)
- No XC time normalization yet - requires AI course rating model first

**3. Crystal Springs Baseline Established**
- **Crystal Springs 2.95 Mile = 1.000 rating (baseline course)**
- All other courses will be rated relative to this standard
- Complete methodology documented in `COURSE_RATING_BASELINE.md`

**4. Data Quality**
- 98%+ data quality (minor outliers documented)
- All foreign keys valid, no orphaned records
- Season years, graduation years all populated correctly

## Immediate Next Steps (6-Hour Plan)

### Phase 1: Frontend Development - View Pages (Current Session Goal!)

**User wants to see:**
1. âœ… **Course difficulty analysis** - Verify system estimates vs. user expectations
2. ðŸ“Š **Team rankings page** - Season standings
3. ðŸ“ˆ **Most improved page** - Team improvement tracking
4. ðŸ‘¤ **Athlete profile page** - Career progression and PRs

**Implementation Plan:**

#### Step 1: Course Difficulty Analysis (30 min)
- Check current `xc_time_rating` values in database
- Compare with user's domain knowledge
- Discuss approach for AI course rating model
- Decision: Use current ratings or wait for AI model?

#### Step 2: Team Rankings Page (90 min)
**Route:** `/teams/rankings/[season]`
- Display all teams ranked by average XC time (top 7 runners)
- Filter by season year (2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)
- Show: rank, school name, average time, top 7 athletes
- Link to school profile page

**Files to create:**
- `app/teams/rankings/[season]/page.tsx`
- `components/teams/TeamRankings.tsx`
- `app/api/teams/rankings/route.ts` (Supabase RPC)

#### Step 3: Most Improved Team Page (60 min)
**Route:** `/teams/most-improved/[season]`
- Compare team average from season N-1 to season N
- Show improvement in seconds
- Highlight biggest gainers
- Filter by school

**Files to create:**
- `app/teams/most-improved/[season]/page.tsx`
- `components/teams/MostImproved.tsx`
- `app/api/teams/most-improved/route.ts`

#### Step 4: Athlete Profile Page (120 min)
**Route:** `/athletes/[id]/profile`
- Career overview: PRs, graduation year, school
- 4-year progression chart (if applicable)
- Per-course PRs (best at each venue)
- All race results with filters (season, meet, course)
- Season-by-season summary

**Files to create:**
- `app/athletes/[id]/profile/page.tsx`
- `components/athletes/AthleteProfile.tsx`
- `components/athletes/ProgressionChart.tsx` (line chart)
- `components/athletes/CourseRecords.tsx`
- `app/api/athletes/[id]/profile/route.ts`

#### Step 5: Testing & Refinement (60 min)
- Test all pages with real data
- Fix any display issues
- Add loading states
- Error handling
- Mobile responsiveness

## Success Metrics

### After completing Phase 1, you should have:
- âœ… Course ratings verified with user input
- âœ… Team rankings page showing 674 schools
- âœ… Most improved teams calculated for each season
- âœ… Athlete profiles displaying 4-year progressions
- âœ… All pages responsive and fast (<1 sec load time)

---

## Database Schema Reminder

### Key Tables
- **venues** - (name, city, state)
- **courses** - (venue_id, distance_meters, layout_version, xc_time_rating)
- **schools** - (name, athletic_net_id)
- **athletes** - (full_name, current_school_id, gender, graduation_year)
- **meets** - (name, meet_date, season_year, athletic_net_id)
- **races** - (meet_id, course_id, name, gender, distance_meters)
- **results** - (athlete_id, race_id, time_cs, place_overall, season_year)

### Materialized Views
- **athlete_course_prs** - Per-course PRs (athlete_id, course_id, best_time_cs, times_raced_here, first_year, last_year)

### Important Field Names
- Use `current_school_id` (not `school_id`) in athletes table
- Courses reference `venue_id` - must JOIN through venues for venue name
- Times stored in **centiseconds** (`time_cs`)
- Gender: boolean (false = male, true = female)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database connection issues
- Check Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Verify `.env.local` has correct SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Test connection with simple query in SQL Editor

### Course ratings seem off
- Current ratings are all 1.000 (default)
- Need to build AI course rating model
- See `COURSE_RATING_BASELINE.md` for methodology

---

## File Organization

### Root Directory (Active Files Only)
- Documentation: 13 .md files
- SQL Scripts: 6 active scripts
- Config: package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.js, etc.

### Archives
- `docs/archive/` - Old session summaries, superseded SQL scripts

## What to Tell Claude Code

**Start with:**
> "Let's build the frontend pages! First, let's verify the course difficulty ratings in the database match what I'd expect. Then we'll build:
> 1. Team rankings page for the season
> 2. Most improved teams page
> 3. Athlete profile page with career progression
>
> Read NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md first for context."
