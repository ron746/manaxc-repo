## ðŸ“ˆ COMPETITIVE & SCALING INSIGHTS

* **Competitive Edge:** The platform is positioned to answer the question: "How is the specific training I am doing impacting my official race outcomes?".
* **Monetization Strategy:** Freemium model targeting the athlete, with a free data/results tier, and two paid tiers for AI features.
* **Key Data Source Targets:** Lynbrook Sports (Historical, Public), Athletic.net (for `ath_net_id` linking/verification).
* **Course Rating Innovation:** Internal difficulty factor is the **1-Mile Track Equivalent**. This is stored in the **`races.xc_time_rating`** field, as difficulty is dependent on the specific course + distance run.
