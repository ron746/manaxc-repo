2. `athletic-net-{schoolId}-{year}-courses.csv`
3. `athletic-net-{schoolId}-{year}-schools.csv`
4. `athletic-net-{schoolId}-{year}-meets.csv`
5. `athletic-net-{schoolId}-{year}-races.csv`

## Data Quality Verification

### Run These SQL Scripts in Supabase

#### 1. Basic Verification
```sql
-- File: CHECK_COUNTS.sql
-- Quick table counts to verify import success
```

#### 2. Comprehensive Analysis
```sql
-- File: VERIFY_4_YEAR_DATA.sql
-- Analyzes:
-- - Results distribution by season
-- - Meets by season
-- - Athletes by graduation year
-- - Gender distribution
-- - Multi-season athlete tracking
-- - 4-year progression candidates
-- - Data quality checks
-- - Top schools and courses
```

#### 3. Athlete PR Calculations
```sql
-- File: REFRESH_ATHLETE_PRS.sql
-- Refreshes materialized view
-- Shows top 20 male/female PRs
-- Analyzes 4-year athlete progressions
```

## Key Insights Expected

### Multi-Season Athletes
With 4 years of data, we can now:
- Track athlete progression from freshman to senior year
- Identify athletes who competed all 4 seasons
- Calculate year-over-year improvement rates
- Build maturation curves from real data

### Graduation Year Distribution
Expected breakdown (based on 2025 = current year):
- **Class of 2025:** Seniors (grade 12) - most results
- **Class of 2026:** Juniors (grade 11)
- **Class of 2027:** Sophomores (grade 10)
- **Class of 2028:** Freshmen (grade 9)
- **Classes 2022-2024:** Alumni (historical data)

### 4-Year Progressions
Athletes who competed in all 4 seasons (2022-2025) represent:
- Complete high school XC careers
- Ideal data for maturation curve validation
- Training progression case studies
- Recruiting benchmarks for coaches

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Per-Course PR View (REQUIRED)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: CREATE_COURSE_PRS.sql
-- This creates athlete_course_prs materialized view
```
**Important:** We are NOT calculating XC time PRs yet (normalized across courses). That requires the AI/statistical model to establish proper course difficulty ratings first.

For now, we're tracking **per-course PRs** (each athlete's best time at each specific course).

### 2. Run Verification Queries
Execute `VERIFY_4_YEAR_DATA.sql` to check:
- âœ… All seasons have data (2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)
- âœ… No missing season_year values
- âœ… No missing graduation_year values
- âœ… All races linked to courses
- âœ… Gender fields populated correctly

### 3. Analyze Course Records and 4-Year Athletes
Execute `VERIFY_COURSE_PRS.sql` to:
- Get course records (fastest times at each course) by gender
- Find athletes who competed all 4 years
- Calculate year-over-year improvement (raw times)
- Identify most versatile athletes (raced at many courses)

### 4. Build AI Course Rating System (FUTURE)
Before we can calculate true XC time PRs, we need to:
- Build statistical model for course difficulty (overlapping runner analysis)
- **Baseline:** Crystal Springs 2.95 Mile = 1.000 rating (ALWAYS)
- Calculate ratings for all other courses relative to Crystal Springs
- Validate ratings with Bayesian testing (mean error < 500 cs)
- **Then** create `athlete_xc_times_v3` with normalized PRs
- See `COURSE_RATING_BASELINE.md` for complete methodology

### 5. Update Frontend Views
Enable new features in the UI:
- **Athlete Profiles:** Show 4-year progression charts (raw times)
- **School Pages:** Display multi-year team results
- **Course Records:** All-time records at each course (by gender)
- **Top Performances:** Show raw PRs until course ratings ready
