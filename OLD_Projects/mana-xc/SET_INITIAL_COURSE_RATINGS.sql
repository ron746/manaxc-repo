-- Set Initial Course Ratings (Manual Assignment - Option B)
-- Based on user's domain knowledge and expected time equivalencies
--
-- User's expected equivalencies (all equal performance):
-- - Crystal Springs 2.95mi: 16:00.0 (baseline = 1.000)
-- - Golden Gate Park 2.93mi: 15:29.7 â†’ rating â‰ˆ 1.033 (3.3% easier)
-- - Montgomery Hill 2.74mi: 15:13.0 â†’ rating â‰ˆ 1.052 (5.2% easier)
-- - Woodward Park 5000m: 16:19.6 â†’ rating â‰ˆ 0.980 (2% harder)
--
-- Range: 0.88 to 1.12 (Â±12% from baseline per user preference)
