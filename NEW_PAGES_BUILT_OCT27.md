# New Pages Built - October 27, 2025

## Summary

Built **3 new pages** from the old project, adapted to the new database schema with proper field name mappings.

## Pages Built

### 1. ✅ Meets List Page
**Route:** `/meets`
**File:** `app/meets/page.tsx`

- Sort by date, name, type, or season
- Pagination (50 meets per page)
- Shows race count for each meet
- Displays course name and location
- Links to meet detail pages

**Schema Adaptations:**
- ✅ Uses `meet_date` (correct field)
- ✅ Uses `season_year` (correct field)
- ✅ Uses `meet_type` (correct field)
- ✅ Joins through `courses` table for venue info
- ✅ Counts races with aggregation

**Styling:**
- Matches site's zinc/cyan color scheme
- Dark gradient background (zinc-900 to zinc-800)

**File:** `app/meets/[meetId]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Meet header with date, season, type, and course
- Stats cards showing:
  - Total races
  - Total participants
  - Fastest time
- Race grid with cards for each race
- Each race card shows:
  - Race name and gender badge
  - Division (Varsity, JV, etc.)
  - Distance (5K, 3 Miles, etc.)
  - Participant count
  - Winning time and winner name
- Click on race card → go to race results (link ready for future page)
- Breadcrumb navigation

**Schema Adaptations:**
- ✅ Uses `meet_date`, `season_year`, `meet_type`, `location`
- ✅ Joins to `courses` for course info
- ✅ Joins to `races` for race list
- ✅ Joins to `results` for participant counts and winning times
- ✅ Handles `distance_meters` field
- ✅ Uses `gender` field from races ('M', 'F')
- ✅ Uses `time_cs` (centiseconds) and formats correctly

**Styling:**

- Clean, modern layout

---

### 3. ✅ School Records Page
**Route:** `/schools/[id]/records`
**File:** `app/schools/[id]/records/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- School records by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
- Toggle between boys and girls records
- Shows for each grade:
  - Best time
  - Athlete name (linked to profile)
  - Meet name
  - Course name
  - Date achieved
- Highlights fastest overall time
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Link back to school roster

**Schema Adaptations:**
- ✅ Uses `school_id` (not `current_school_id` like old schema)

- ✅ Formula: `grade = 12 - (grad_year - season_year)`
- ✅ Uses `time_cs` (centiseconds, not `time_seconds`)
- ✅ Uses `gender` field ('M', 'F' strings, not boolean)
- ✅ Joins through `races` → `meets` → `courses`
- ✅ Groups by grade and finds minimum time per grade

**Styling:**
- Gender toggle buttons with blue/pink themes
- Table layout with highlighted fastest time
- Cyan links to athlete profiles
- Responsive table with horizontal scroll

## Key Schema Differences Handled

### Old Schema → New Schema Mappings:

| Feature | Old Schema | New Schema | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Time Storage** | `time_seconds` (INTEGER) | `time_cs` (INTEGER) | ✅ Updated |
| **School Relation** | `current_school_id` | `school_id` | ✅ Updated |
| **Race Relationship** | Direct `meet_id` | `race_id` → `meet_id` | ✅ Updated |
| **Gender Field** | `gender` (BOOLEAN in some tables) | `gender` (TEXT 'M'/'F') | ✅ Updated |
| **Meet Fields** | `meet_date`, `meet_type`, `venue` | `meet_date`, `meet_type`, `course_id` | ✅ Updated |

### Time Conversion
- Old: `time_seconds` stored as seconds (e.g., 1170 for 19:30)
- New: `time_cs` stored as centiseconds (e.g., 117000 for 19:30.00)
- **Formula:** `time_cs / 6000` = minutes, `(time_cs % 6000) / 100` = seconds
- **Utility:** Using `formatTime()` from `lib/utils/time.ts`

### Grade Calculation
- Old: Stored current grade directly
- New: Calculate from `grad_year` using: `12 - (grad_year - current_season_year)`
- **Example:** Athlete with `grad_year = 2026` in 2025 season → Grade 11

## Known Limitations (Need Data to Test)

1. **No Data Yet:** Database is currently empty, so pages will show "No meets/records found"
2. **Race Results Page:** Meet detail links to `/meets/[meetId]/races/[raceId]` (not built yet)
3. **XC Time Normalization:** School records don't use course normalization yet (need `xc_time_rating` field)

---

## Next Steps (Future Pages to Build)

### High Priority
1. **Race Results Page** (`/meets/[meetId]/races/[raceId]`)
   - Individual results table
   - Team standings with scoring
   - 2-3 hours to build

2. **School Seasons Pages**
   - Season list (`/schools/[id]/seasons`)
   - Season detail (`/schools/[id]/seasons/[year]`)
   - 2-3 hours to build

### Medium Priority
3. **Course Detail Pages**
   - Course info (`/courses/[id]`)
   - Course records (`/courses/[id]/records`)
   - Course top performances (`/courses/[id]/performances`)
   - 4-5 hours to build

### Low Priority
4. **Admin/Import Tools**
5. **Authentication Pages**
6. **Search Page**

---

## Performance Notes

- All pages use client-side rendering (`'use client'`)
- Queries optimized with proper joins
- No N+1 query problems
- Pagination implemented for large datasets
- Client-side filtering and sorting (fine for <10K records)

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript types for all data structures
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Loading states on all pages
- ✅ Empty states handled gracefully
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind
- ✅ Proper Next.js patterns (useParams, useRouter, Link)
- ✅ Reusable formatters from `lib/utils/time.ts`
- ✅ Clean component structure

---

## Development Environment

**Server Running:** http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Hot reload working
- ✅ All routes accessible

---

## Session Summary

**Time Spent:** ~45 minutes
**Pages Completed:** 3/3
**Status:** ✅ ALL COMPLETE

All pages are:
- Built with correct schema field names
- Styled to match site design
- Responsive and accessible
- Ready for data import
- Properly linked with navigation

**Ready to test with real data once import script is fixed!**

---

**Created:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** Complete
**Next Action:** Fix data import script and populate database
