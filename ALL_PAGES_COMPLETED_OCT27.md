- ✅ Consistent error handling (try/catch)
- ✅ Loading states on all pages
- ✅ Empty states handled ("No data found")
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind
- ✅ Proper Next.js patterns (useParams, Link)
- ✅ Reusable formatters from `lib/utils/time.ts`
- ✅ Clean component structure
- ✅ Consistent styling (zinc/cyan theme)

---

## Team Scoring Algorithm (Race Results)

Implemented proper XC team scoring:

```typescript
// 1. Group results by school
// 2. For each school:
//    - Take top 5 runners (scorers)
//    - Take 6th-7th runners (displacement)
// 3. Calculate score = sum of top 5 places
// 4. Sort teams by score (lowest wins)
// 5. Mark incomplete teams (< 5 runners)
```

Features:
- ✅ Scorers shown as: 1, 2, 5, 8, 12 (places)
- ✅ Displacement runners shown as: (15), (20)
- ✅ Incomplete teams marked and shown separately
- ✅ Winning team highlighted (yellow background)
- ✅ School names linked to school pages

---

## Remaining Pages (8 pages - Low Priority)

### Could Still Build (But Not Essential)
1. **Combined Results** (`/meets/[meetId]/combined`) - XC normalization
2. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`) - System stats
3. **Mass Import** (`/admin/mass-import`) - Bulk upload
4. **Data Import** (`/import`) - CSV wizard
5. **Login** (`/auth/login`) - Authentication
6. **Signup** (`/auth/signup`) - Registration
7. **Search** (`/search`) - Multi-entity search
8. **Course Import** (`/courses/import-courses`) - Admin tool

**Note:** These are admin/auth pages that can wait. Core functionality is 100% complete!

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Current Implementation
- Client-side filtering and sorting (fine for < 10K records)
- Single queries with nested joins
- Pagination where needed (50-500 results)
- Efficient Supabase queries

### Future Enhancements (If Needed)
- Server-side filtering for very large datasets
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Database indexes (already defined in schema)
- Caching strategies

- Team scoring and results
- School records and history
- Course rankings
- Athlete profiles

### Priority 2: Polish
After data is in:
1. Test all pages with real data
2. Fix any edge cases found
3. Add export/print features
4. Optimize queries if needed

### Priority 3: Enhance
Optional enhancements:
1. XC time normalization (for combined results)
2. Advanced search
3. Admin tools
4. User accounts
