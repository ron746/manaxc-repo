## Feature Gaps Analysis

### Missing Database Features

#### 1. XC Time Normalization System ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** Cannot fairly compare times across different courses

**Old System:**
- Courses had `xc_time_rating` multiplier field
- Courses had `mile_difficulty` rating
- Results used these to calculate normalized times

**New System:**
- Courses only have `difficulty_rating` (1-10 scale)
- No `xc_time_rating` field
- No normalization functions

**Required:**
- Option A: Add `xc_time_rating` to courses table
- Option B: Calculate dynamically from historical data
- Option C: Use `difficulty_rating` as proxy (less accurate)

#### 2. RPC Functions ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** Cannot efficiently query school/course records

**Missing Functions:**
```sql
-- School records by grade level
get_school_xc_records(school_id, gender)

-- Top 10 all-time performances
get_school_top10_xc(school_id, gender)

-- Course-specific school records
get_school_course_records(school_id, course_id, gender)

-- Course records by grade
get_course_records(course_id, gender)

-- Top 50 course performances
get_course_top_performances(course_id, gender, limit)
```

#### 3. Database Views
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** Slower queries, more complex client-side logic

**Missing Views:**
```sql
-- Results with full details
CREATE VIEW results_with_details AS ...

-- Athlete season statistics
CREATE VIEW athlete_season_stats AS ...

-- Team rankings
CREATE VIEW team_rankings AS ...
```

#### 4. Team Scoring Logic
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** Cannot display team standings

**Required:**
- Top 5 runners score
- 6th-7th displacement runners
- Team score = sum of top 5 places
- Incomplete teams (< 5 runners)

---

   - Scoring vs non-scoring indicators
   - PR markers
   - Sortable columns

3. **RecordsDisplay**

   - Gender-separated sections
   - School/course filters
   - All-time vs season records

4. **SeasonStatsCard**

   - Season selector

5. **CourseInfoCard**
   - Distance, difficulty, rating
   - XC time conversion info
   - Race/results counts

6. **MeetCard**
   - Meet name, date, type
