# Data Import Analysis - October 26, 2025

## Status: Partial Success ⚠️

### What Imported Successfully ✅
Based on the import log:
- **119 courses** loaded into database
- **422 unique meets** identified
- **6,711 valid results** parsed

### What Failed ❌
- **ALL 1,062 athletes failed** to import due to check constraint violation

---

## Root Cause: Graduation Year vs. Grade Level

**The Problem:**
The import script is storing the athlete's **current grade** (9, 10, 11, 12) in the `grad_year` column, but the database expects a **4-digit graduation year** (2025, 2026, 2027, 2028).

**Example Errors:**
```
Adrian Ketterer | 2026 → tried to insert grad_year=11 (should be 2026)
Jack Arango | 2025 → tried to insert grad_year=12 (should be 2025)
Anshul Dhaas | 2027 → tried to insert grad_year=10 (should be 2027)
```

**Database Constraint:**
The `athletes_grad_year_check` constraint is rejecting values 9-12 because it expects years >= 1900.

## Impact Assessment

### Tables with Data
1. ✅ **schools** - At least Westmont imported
2. ✅ **courses** - 119 courses loaded
3. ❓ **meets** - Unknown count (need to check database)
4. ❓ **races** - Unknown count
5. ❌ **athletes** - 0 imported (all failed)
6. ❌ **results** - Likely 0 (depends on athletes)

### Cascading Effect
Since athletes failed to import, **results probably didn't import either** (foreign key dependency).

## The Fix

### Option 1: Fix the Import Script (Recommended)
The import script needs to convert grade to graduation year:

```python
# Current (WRONG):
grad_year = student_grade  # 9, 10, 11, 12

# Fixed (CORRECT):
current_year = 2024  # or datetime.now().year
grad_year = current_year + (13 - student_grade)  # Converts grade to graduation year

# Examples:
# Grade 9 (2024) → 2024 + (13 - 9) = 2028
# Grade 10 (2024) → 2024 + (13 - 10) = 2027
# Grade 11 (2024) → 2024 + (13 - 11) = 2026
# Grade 12 (2024) → 2024 + (13 - 12) = 2025
```

### Option 2: Modify Database Constraint (NOT Recommended)
Could remove the check constraint, but this would allow invalid data.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify What's in Database**
   - Run query to count records in each table
   - Check if courses and meets actually imported

2. **Fix Import Script**
   - Locate the athlete import code
   - Add grade-to-graduation-year conversion
   - Test with a few athletes first

3. **Clean and Re-import**
   - Option A: Delete all data and re-import everything
   - Option B: Just import athletes and results (if courses/meets are good)

4. **Validate Data Quality**
   - Check that all relationships are correct
   - Verify time conversions worked
   - Test a few sample queries

## Files to Review

1. **/code/importers/import_westmont_excel.py** - The main import script
2. **/code/importers/import_log.txt** - Full error log
3. **Database** - Check current record counts

---

## Recommended Action

**I recommend:**
1. First, let's check what's actually in the database (run query in Supabase)
2. Then fix the import script with proper grade→grad_year conversion
3. Clean the database and re-import everything from scratch

This way we ensure clean, complete data from the start.
